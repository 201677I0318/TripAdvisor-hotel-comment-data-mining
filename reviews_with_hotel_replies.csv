Radisson RED Miami Airport,5,Afternoon meal with Moisely.,"I stopped in for a bite to eat and drinks. I had the  Bravo Burger, medium with everything it comes with...delicious.  The STAR for me was the EXTRA spicy Bloody Mary made with Don Julio silver tequila. Moisely balanced the flavors and spicy VERY well! (So much so, that I may or may not have had 3 after the first one lol).  When Moisely became busy, she was sure to communicate what was going on, which was comforting to me because thoughtful things like that are often over looked.  Hands down BEST service and BEST Bloody Mary I have had in a while.  Would totally return and recommend. ","Thank you for sharing your positive experience during your visit for food and drinks.

The best part of our stay was the overall hospitality of the staff! We stayed for breakfast and were greeted by the breakfast attendant, Asia.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,4,One night end of cruise stay,"Dadiel at the front desk was very accommodating. We arrived early right from ship and he was able to get us into our room early, which we greatly appreciated. The hotel is made for just a one or two night stay-simple room, beds were comfortable, shower was spacious & nice and hot. Not much room for your toiletries.  Did not go to the bar in the lobby but was available all day. Easy to get an Uber to the beach. No hot tub at the pool, just a basic pool.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Inappropriate Staff Behavior,"Hello, I want to leave my opinion about my stay at the Red Radisson Hotel, which was very bad since I asked for service and they did not give it to me. The houskiping manager rudely said that because of the covid, it did not touch me, which is absurd since neither he The government sees it that way and then I asked for towels, which they did not take me and the manager stood rudely in front of me in Spanish with another worker, speaking badly and saying that I should not think that they would give me service because I demand it, which is every three days, whether I want it or not, she never suspected that I speak Spanish perfectly, it seems unfortunate and unethical to me that they treat their clients like this, which is a fact, I never stay in that hotel again.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Don't stay,"Don't stay the pictures of the rooms look way better than what you get. They advertise a rooftop bar that doesn't exist. Breakfast is $12 per person in the bar doesn't have half of what's on its menu. I left them item here, but because it wasn't between nine and five, nobody could even check to see if it was in lost and found. When I pointed these things out, nothing was done to make accommodations. Find another hotel.","Thank you for posting a review.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Don't stay here,"Bad service and staff that are rude and don't seem to care to address things. Breakfast says it's included but it's actually $12 per person for a crappy cheap breakfast. Management doesn't care to fix things, as they are too busy to address guests in person when asking to speak with them. The staff slam the doors in the halls and it makes it loud in the rooms.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Industrial Chic. YUK,"Industrial chic not my style. Concrete ceilings and some walls scuffed to make look like light use. Bathrooms horrible. No shelf/counter space to put meds, makeup, curling iron. Shower floor very slippery.Locker room style storage units for clothing. Decent food, but bright cafeteria style bar. No wine at all on a Tuesday. Shuttle pick at airport SLOOOW, over 20 minute wait. Same for drop off the next day","Hi,  I'm sorry that you weren't completely pleased with your stay.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,3,manis & kogie for sleep over,"The Radisson RED Miami Airport is a good hotel for a short stay. It has got everything you need to relax between flights like a gym, a pool and a smal bar. Nothing spectacular. Great is the service with the airport shuttle bus. The location is not as good - that's why it is an airport hotel.","Hi,  We're glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and understanding that the benefit of our location is the proximity we have to the airport and how centered we are and the convenience of not being far away from every touristic area in the city.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Anniversary upgrade denied.,"Rude rude RUDE I hadn't even walked all the way in when the lady at the counter was already being extremely rude I proceeded with kindness. I asked her if there was a way to upgrade my room because it was my 10 year wedding anniversary and she said there's no complimentary upgrade and then elaborated that was not expecting a complimentary upgrade. However, I was willing to pay and she was still extremely rude and I feel like she didn't want to help me definitely last time I'll be booking at this hotel.","Hello,  We're sorry your experience didn't match your expectations.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,3,Ok for a quick layover,"Average airport hotel. We only had a one night layover before the next stop at our journey so did not use many amenities. Room was clean. Don't bother with the breakfast - limited choices and none of them appetizing. Also, please make note of the close proximity to the airport - you will hear the planes.","Hi,  I'm sorry that you weren't completely satisfied/pleased with your stay.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,The dirtiest hotel in the world,"I stayed in this hotel for 9 nights and to my surprise they don't clean the rooms.  They claim it's because of the pandemic, but the pandemic is gone and even in the pandemic the hotels I visited were clean.  I complained and nothing was done.  Dirty rooms, dirty bathrooms, which qualifies this hotel as filthy, which does not care about hygiene.","Hi,  I'm sorry to hear that you had this experience and I completely understand why you are frustrated.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Terrible customer service,"I booked two rooms at the military/government rate, since we are retired veterans. Let me start by saying I booked this property due to the free breakfast and the discount to the military. I support businesses that support the military.  Check in was an issue the two ladies that were in the front were deep in a conversation I felt I was inconveniencing them by us checking in to the hotel. Once I said "" we need to check in "" they stopped talking and started to assist.   The next morning we got up and headed to the buffet. The nice lady at the register informed us that we need a voucher or pay the $13 for us to eat breakfast. Breakfast was included so I went to the front for her to look up our reservations since I couldn't access it on my phone since check in had passed. The lady","Hi Sophia,  We pride ourselves on our professional service and I'm sorry to hear you had a frustrating experience.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,One Star ,"The desk area was not what I expected.  There was not plug on desk for laptop/computers, no desk lamp,  chair at table did not have wheels.  The iron leaked water once put in.  Staff never cleaned my room (I had a four day stay), no extra toilet paper in the room.  I called for more and I was told I had to go to the front desk... this was at night when I was already retired and ready for bed.",Hi!

Radisson RED Miami Airport,3,"My Experience was Ok, not more than that","Close to MIA Airport. Hotel looks new, offers shuttle service. Room was good size, but walls at the entrance of it were very dirty.  No places to eat around. Service is ok.  Terrible to attend a telephone call.  At arrival called more than 20 times to arrange pick up, never got an answer and the bus never passed by the Hotel Shuttle station at the airport. Got to take an Uber to get there.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,3,Nice hotel in wrong area,Hotel is industrial modern but is not near anything but strip clubs/adult entertainment establishments.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,3,"Cool design, good location, horribly impractical room.","Pluses: -Location is perfect for a one-night stay with an early flight. My husband was able to return our rental car and walk back to the hotel in about 10 minutes.  -Shuttle to the airport was right on time (6am) and got us to our gate in less than 10 minutes. -Clean room and bathroom, comfortable bed.  Cons: -While the modern design is very cool, it's clear that the designer never thought about people actually being *in* it: the walls are flat and white, which might've been nice for two weeks after opening, but now they all look grimy and scuffed. This is both in the hallways and inside the room. It was clean, but the scruffy walls really made it look dingy.  -The room is decorated in a minimalist style that is horribly impractical. There isn't a closet, just a metal locker.","Hi Maria,  I'm sorry that you weren't completely satisfied with your stay. We appreciate your feedback and if there is anything further you would like to share, we're available to take your call. I hope we have the opportunity to deliver a five-star experience next time."
Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Canceled my reservation and won't give me my money back,"My wife and I arrived at the hotel at 2am excited for a good night's sleep before our anniversary cruise. When I arrived, the computer system was down. Instead of honoring my reservation, they told me that I was unable to stay with them that night and that I would need to WALK DOWN THE STREET to find another hotel. Instead of giving me anything in writing, they took my information and told me that they would be giving me a refund. With no refund, I issued a chargeback. Two months later they now are disputing it. Do not stay here if you value your money and your sanity. Absolutely awful.","Hello,  I'm sorry to hear you weren't completely satisfied with your stay.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Disappointing is not even near,What an awful place ... a RIP OFF  Staff struggle with English and have no manners ... have no concept about customer service ... we are just an inconvenience   It's expensive and has zero quality ... food standards poor  I would struggle to even recommend this place to someone I don't like  The only quality ... a good bathroom  Breakfast ,"Greetings,  I'm sorry that you weren't completely satisfied with your stay.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,3,Not close to anything,Continental breakfast was supposed to be included in our stay when we went down it was $15.50 Way-over priced. Ended up being a good thing because we took some takeout from the bar and it was so gross so we couldn't eat it dry cold never again and it cost $50 for two people that is outrageous no matter what city you're in and we were in about to go back downstairs to complain! Very nice bus driver from the airport. Gave us no help with trying to find a drugstore,"Hi Debbie,  I'm sorry to hear you weren't completely satisfied with your stay.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,2,Need lots of improvements,"Many improvements needed with beds and pillows to fitness center and front desk. Honestly, I will never come to this hotel again. Bottles of water needed since you proved 2 small ones and make people pay 7 dollars per bottle. ","Hi,  I'm sorry that you weren't completely satisfied with your stay.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,2,At least we had a bed to sleep in,"We booked here for one night before a cruise. And we are so happy it was just one night!  We won't stay here again and we'd not recommend this hotel.   First- they offer a free shuttle from the airport.   We waited where they told us.  The driver pulled up, got out of the shuttle van, and then disappeared for about :15 min.   He returned to the vehicle and was ready to pull away when one of the other couples standing with us waved him down and said there were 6 people waiting for him.  We get to the hotel early so we weren't expecting our room to be ready.  And it wasn't.  But there were a handful of other families who arrived too and the lobby has about 4 chairs and three tables/chairs.   Not a very welcoming lobby....nor was one of the staff members.   They did take our bags","Hi Johlice,  I'm sorry to hear you weren't completely satisfied with your stay.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Never Stay Here,"While I understand this is a new hotel it is not ready for prime time.  Our room had holes in the wall with temporary patches and bedroom wall had dents and scratches.  The bathroom was poorly designed because there is no shower door which means the water pools on bathroom floor so you have to use more towels to dry the floor.  When we requested additional towels we were told that we had to go down to the front desk to get them.  The towels were in a pile on same desk that you do the check in, so not sanitary.  Then the beds and bedding was very uncomfortable.  Finally the buffet lacked sufficient food to guest.","Hello,  I'm sorry to hear that you had this experience and I completely understand why you are frustrated.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,2,"Very, Very Poor Room Service","Housekeeping sucks, we spent 4 nights here and have yet to have our room cleaned.  No shampoo or conditioner.  We have asked twice to have our room cleaned, both times just received more towels.  The room is nice, but I have never jade service this bad.   Lesser hotel chains have better service than here.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,Loud!  Not adequately soundproofed from runway,"One of the worst nights of sleep I have ever had in any hotel, and I travel a lot. (And yes, I do have earplugs).   Most airport hotels - such as the TWA Hotel in JFK - make a point of soundproofing themselves from the airport operations nearby.  Not this one. It sounded as if the airplanes were landing between our two double beds.  On the plus side, the hotel is very new and our beds were comfortable. On the negative side, the restaurant ran out of everything on the menu except chicken wings by 9pm.  I do not recommend this hotel.","Hi,  I'm sorry that you weren't completely satisfied with your stay. We appreciate your feedback and if there is anything further you would like to share, we're available to take your call. I hope we have the opportunity to deliver a five-star experience next time."
Radisson RED Miami Airport,2,Don't do it!!,"Check in took far too long. Our room was ok but not the cleanest. There was no body wash throughout the entire hotel. The restaurant and bar closed at 11 on a Saturday night and there is nothing else in the area. The breakfast was worse then free continental breakfast at other hotels, plus they served coffee out of a plastic drink cup. Overall it was not worth the price. I will be looking for somewhere else to stay next time.","Hello,  I'm sorry to hear that you had this experience and I completely understand why you are frustrated. This will be a training opportunity for us as we strive to provide the best possible service for our guests.

Radisson RED Miami Airport,1,A distressed hotel,"I booked Radisson Red in hopes of finding a new hotel to stay at on regular trips to Miami.  Guided by early reviews, along which a chic YouTube preview, and the fact the hotel is new, I went ahead and booked.  The initial wow factor was over the top, and went straight downhill from there.  Once in bed, it became apparent the sheets had either been shook out and the bed remade, or the housekeeping staff was washing the bedding with an incredibly excessive amount of soap.  I began itching from my scalp to feet and everywhere between.  The more I ignored it, the worse it got.  There I was at sunrise trying to counter this by dumping gold bond powder all over my body.  A full sleepless night and my entry into the ‘Radisson Red' experience.  At that point I had no choice except to","Greetings,  Thanks for sharing your feedback. We're sorry your experience didn't match your expectations. It was an uncommon instance and we'll do better in the future.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Non existent service recovery,"Their check in system shut down and overbooked about 5-7 families that arrived past midnight during the holiday season. Even tho i did my part in checking in via their app the day before, they still gave out my room. Requested for my rightful compensation as a Titanium but the resolution team, at first, denied this ever happened according to their ""records."" And as I refuted their argument with my receipts, the property and bonvoy resolution team both have been ghosting my past three emails. Service recovery for its Titanium member is non-existent.","Thank you for taking the time to leave a review, Jino.

Element Miami International Airport,1,"Dirty rooms, no management on site, the worst of the worst......","I recently used 70,000 bonboy points to stay five nights (Nov 24-25, 2021) on this property.  This was my first and will be my last time on this hotel. I experienced lot of discrepancies (including a very dirty floor) since I arrived on the property, on Nov 24 near 1000 pm.  I decided to stay that night because I had a long day and I was very tired to get out and start to look for another hotel on the area. Around 800 am on Nov 25, Thanksgiving day; I talked to the man on the front desk, I asked for a manager, he told me that no manager on duty.  I explained him some of the issues with the room, I requested if they can send someone to vacuum and clean the floors, he told me that I had to wait till the next day, no employees available to clean the floor.  I saw three",Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. It is never our intention to disappoint a guest.

Element Miami International Airport,3,"OK, not great","This hotel was fine, not great but conveniently located by Miami Airport and offering a shuttle.   The hotel wasn't well kept and we had some maintenance issues.   Again, fine for a short stay if you need to stay near Miami Airport.  I would not discourage you from having a short stay.","Thank you for sharing your experience, Beachluvinfamily.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Convenient stop over hotel,"We have stayed here before when we needed to make a morning flight out of Miami. It has changed somewhat due to COVID-19 restrictions and other reasons. The Salon, an evening eating and drinking area is closed.  There is a pantry area to buy drinks and snacks, but there was also a chicken Caesar salad that was a pleasant treat after a long day of travel and a late night arrival. There is still breakfast in the morning with some beverages and some packages items. The hotel and our room seemed clean, but my wife saw a large hair in the shower, so we wonder what else was missed during cleaning. The shuttle service is quick and the drivers are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, the luxurious Mercedes vans have been replaced by efficient Ford vans.","Thank you for sharing feedback on your guestroom during your recent stay, joe-chicago-23.

Element Miami International Airport,2,"Bummer, expect better from Marriott","Booked a room with two queen beds and a pull out couch, arrived at almost midnight and was given a studio with one king bed.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Changes...not for the better ,"I reviewed this property 2 months  ago, and the change is remarkable.  Deep cleaning or lack thereof is evident from attached photos.  The room came sans any towels which I promptly requested, however they were never delivered during my stay.  The front desk remains unattended regularly.  Carpet throughout is soiled and covered with regular stains of unknown origins.  Elevators smelled of stale beer and odors normally reserved for public restrooms.  I can not recommend this property in the current condition.","Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. Cleanliness at our hotel is a top priority, and we apologize that your guest room fell short of your expectations.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Awful from start to finish,I am a titanium elite member and travel extensively.  This awful stay on 11/19/21 started out by waiting at the airport for one hour for a shuttle that never came.   We kept calling the hotel and no one answered the phone.   Finally we took a taxi....

Element Miami International Airport,2,Two Nights Too Many,"We stayed here for two nights and honestly the hotel was the worst part of our trip! The stay started badly with us having to wait close to 50 minutes for the hotel shuttle to arrive. Each time we called the desk a very rude representative said they run every 30 minutes and would say they sent the driver or that the driver was on his way. The hotel is minutes away from the airport so this was unacceptable. There was also an app that they suggested we use to track the shuttle which was completely inaccurate. It would say it had arrived or was a few minutes away when the driver was nowhere near close. The driver that did show up was incredibly rude but I do want to add that the alternate driver; Victor, that took us back to the airport was incredibly friendly. Another couple on",Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. It is never our intention to disappoint a guest.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Disapointing,"We checked into this hotel. As a Bonvoy member I try to use the Marriott chain. We had a 3 night stay and we wanted also to be close to the airport.  When we checked in, usually we are acknoledge being Bonvoy, but did not. On my profile we ask for extra towels, had only 2. We were not told the housecleaning only happens with a day notice or there is none. We had put our towels on the ground the next morning thinking they would be replaced, but we were unaware of their policy.  When we got back to the room, we found this out and asked to get some new towels so we can wash up. No one came so we called the desk again. This time the employee told us we need to wait since there is only 1 person for the whole hotel.   We would have taken our used towel but the floors have not been",We appreciate you taking the time to leave a review.

Our team's commitment to service and guest satisfaction is our main focus, and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay. Looking forward to welcoming you back again soon!"
Element Miami International Airport,1,Terrible customer service,"If I could give 0 stars I would. The manager is VERY rude. You would think that hospitality professionals would know how to speak to customers or handle certain situations with class when the hotel has made an error. The check in time on my app states 10:30am. It's not 2:20pm and they are still claiming that there are no rooms available yet. I called ahead to request early check in and was advised that it would be possible, but the hotel has no answers as to why my rooms aren't ready. The employee has no idea what's going on and the manager has done nothing to assist. He just keeps ignoring any questions that I ask him. He has a very unwelcoming and impolite demeanor. I advised that I was a Bonvoy rewards member and the front desk agent advised that that only means that I would",Thank you for taking the time to review us.

Element Miami International Airport,2,A Dang Shame... Period!,This place looks like it was built to be great. The actual room is very modern but let me tell you the hotel itself needs to be cleaned up I didn't even Venture down to the pool after looking out the window the pool looks dirty and the ground looks unkept. The pots or so tattered that I was unable to use them to cook food which meant I had to buy food from the local restaurants. We got this room based on being able to use the kitchen facility. We are Ambassador Elite customers I spend a lot of time traveling the Marriott brand I must say that this place is a disappointment. We spent two nights here the upside is that it's very close to the airport and the staff was very.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Terrible Stay...one of the Worst,"Really awful experience here.  I actually called Marriott corporate to discuss this stay, but after a 24 minute wait when a wait of 10 minutes was stated, I gave up.  My how Marriott has fallen.  I am also a Gold Elite member.  First impressions were terrible.  The parking lot lights were either so dark or out, it was almost impossible to find this place and I felt unsafe.  The lobby was also not air conditioned! In Miami!  Hello, where is the manager?!?  Staff was very poor here with multiple interactions.  They were dressed unprofessionally and some were flat out rude.   Also the cliente staying here was terrible.  Imagine obese women walking around in thongs in the lobby.     Room was dark and musty.  I asked to change rooms but none were available.  The room was dirty with",Hi TucsonLocal1.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Terrible rude service,"We were given a rate at the airport by the driver and upon check in I asked to confirm. The rate was now $40 more! The guy at check in, after telling him the situation was just shrugging his shoulders and clearly wasn't interested in solving it. I asked for the manager who then presented herself. Not only was she just as rude and not interested in solving the issue, she looked as if she had just fallen out of bed with her pajamas still on.  We were further told the hotel had  a restaurant which turned out to be a food truck. Stay away unless you like unfriendly and rude service.  We went next door to the Even and had a wonderful experience with friendly service and an open restaurant.","Hi, SolveigF60. Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback.

Was informed driver quit and no more service from 11 pm until 5 am Ok, I can deal with that , went into room and thought I had entered a Motel 6. Immediately checked out. Front desk said they would refund my two nights of certificates. Still waiting. Will probably not recover those, I can't believe this is in the Marriott family of hotels.","Hi, traveller2107.

Element Miami International Airport,1,What happened to this place. Disgusting and absolutely unacceptable.,"Please check out the photos. I'm shocked that Marriott doesn't do inspections because this hotel is hurting by beloved Element brand. High traffic area carpets in halls and elevators look like they have not been cleaned in years. The hotel looks and feels dirty.  Pots and pans in the room were discussing. Ac temp didn't work to the set temp. See photos. The closest and cabinet doors still had the oily fingerprints from the previous guests. Found hair in the nasty fridge.  I loved Element breakfast and I know we are in Covid times but that not and excuse for this sorry and sad breakfast at this hotel. See photos. The photos is the entire breakfast. Look at the photo for the hot water. Yuk! And they didn't even have black tea.  It's not like this is a 40 bucks motel, it's like 240","Thank you for taking the time to review us, triton033.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Not bad at all,Looks like a new hotel even though it's been around for a minute. The staff is courteous and helpful with any requests. They offered the complimentary 4pm check out for the titanium elite status. The rooms are probably better than most miami hotel airports in size and condition. Would stay again for a short airport layover.,Thank you so much for the positive feedback! We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!
Element Miami International Airport,1,Gross.,"C'mon, TripAdvisors: this hotel is so dirty as to legitimately be unsafe during a pandemic and you rate it four stars? Stayed here for a few unfortunate hours and had to request a room change because we found dust, food crumbs, and hair on the tables and chairs in our first room. Second room had the same: mystery hair, dust, and stains all over the floor and bathrooom. Finally gave up and just left the hotel rather than risk a COVID infection: if I can see someone else's hair and food in the room when I check in, who knows what I can't see?! This was a truly disgusting experience. Shame on Marriott for putting its employees and customers at risk by failing to do even basic cleaning when we're all trying to stay safe—and shame on prior reviewers for suggesting this is anything","Thank you for taking the time to review us, SPG P.

Alfredo helped me use the hotel's laundromat (it's hard for me to physically operate the machine), as well as do various other helpful gestures/favors. Thank you Alfredo and the entire staff for their friendliness!  The hotel location and room position were also spot-on, which is the last positive I can mention about my experience.

The room indeed had 2 wash cloths but one was dirty in the shower  the shower might have been rinsed but not wiped as I took a wipe to the shower and came up with yuck stuff!

Our room had a good studio layout with a big window. Those are the only good things about this hotel. Our room was super dirty! There was dirt, not just dust everywhere. We only received bath towels and no hand towels. There was no soap, so we used shower gel to wash our hands. There was also a black mold on the ceiling.  I don't understand why our room was not clean since there were hardly any people there during COVID 19 pandemic. I am never staying there again!

Element Miami International Airport,5,Terrific Emergency Stay!,"An unplanned stay at the Element Miami International Airport was a blessing after a long night.  While my night there was unexpected, it gave such a favorable impression that this will likely be my hotel of choice when returning to the area.  Providing a free shuttle service, even well into the wee hours of the morning after other hotels stop their service for the day, it is an extremely short ride from MIA to the hotel.  I arrived at roughly 2am and waited behind some other distressed passengers while waiting to check-in.  The room was well laid out and full of amenities.  In fact, this would be a perfect place to stay for those requiring an extended stay.  The room was large, clean and extremely comfortable.

We arrived very early and Emilio(shuttle driver) picked us up at the airport. He was amazing.  He was friendly, courteous and basically a tour guide. He gave us tips on where to eat and what to see on our quick weekend in Miami. We got to the hotel much too early to check-in and were exhausted.  Thinking maybe we could lay by the pool until the afternoon check-in, I approached the front desk. I was greeted warm and enthusiastic by Fran. She said she could check us in then. Wow!  She was always at the front desk(I'm not sure she ever went home!) and each time was just as friendly. The room was clean, up to date and well thought out.  We had a great pool view.

The bathroom had a shower only. And the kitchen sink had 2 faucets - never did figure out why.  There was free beer and wine during the happy hour in the lobby., and the continental breakfast was free in the morning. We did not have time to use the pool.

Breakfast is one of my favorite amenities at a Hotel & the breakfast here at the Element was poorly prepared the muffins were TOO soggy, the muffins were cold, the muffins were too watery, the fact that breakfast staff saw nothing wrong with this is very telling! How could you take pride in serving such a poor breakfast to your guest turkey sausage everyday was the WORST!","Hi newjerseyu,   We apologize for the disorganization and poor breakfast you experienced during your stay. We will be discussing this feedback with both teams immediately. We appreciate you staying with us and hope to have you back s we may rectify the issues you experienced.   Thank you,   Meredith P. "
Element Miami International Airport,1,The Housekeeping Staff & Brandon were the only ones who provided good service!,"Let me start off by saying the  only good thing about the hotel is the Housekeeping staff & Brandon the overnight agent. Brandon was very warm, friendly & EFFECTIVE in fulfilling any request we made. Next housekeeping tended to our room everyday they made our beds, gave us fresh towels & took out our trash. The engineering department came right away when called and fixed the issue the first time around. The DAYTIME front office team is terrible, unorganized & poorly trained.","Hi 575doctord,   Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for your kind words about Brandon and our housekeeping team. We apologize for the issues you experienced with our front desk team during your stay, and we will be discussing this feedback with our team immediately. We hope to have you back soon.   Meredith P."
Element Miami International Airport,3,Nice Hotel But...,"We stayed at this Hotel using the park and fly.  I must say one of the perks is the shuttle service to the airport which is very close by.  The hotel is very clean and the rooms are nice.  The staff are very friendly but they need training in basic customer service things, for example making sure towels are in the room.  Making sure all the electronics in the room are in working condition. Opening the bar on time.  These things are important to customers and if they could get their act together I would have given this a much better review.",Thank you for providing us with your honest feedback. Our goal is to ensure that we are ready to meet and exceed the expectation of all of our guests through the services that we provide. We apologize if we fell short in some areas. We will share your feedback with the team as a way of understanding our guests needs. We hope to welcome you back soon.
Element Miami International Airport,5,Shuttle Service - Orlando (Driver),"Orlando knows service! He's warm, friendly and very professional. Great service, very personable.

Element Miami International Airport,5,The Front Office Manger is Excellent,"My sister and I are staying here while she is having treatment at a hospital.  As a result we have had to extend our stay twice.  The first time I requested to be moved to a smaller less expensive room and the receptionist was not able to help me.  However the front office manager Bensen Belfort straight away in a calm and professional manner was able to assist us.  When I had to extend the room again, Mr. Belfort he was able to extend the same room without us having to move rooms. He was so understanding and I am very impressed with his unassuming and efficient manner.  He is what a manager should be and is a great asset to the hotel.    The hotel is modern, clean and staff very helpful and friendly.  Close to the airport and the airport train and bus station for getting",Thank you for sharing your experience with us! We are happy to hear that Bensen was able to assist you promptly during your stay. We will surely relay your kind words to him! We hope to see you again soon!

Element Miami International Airport,5,Nice express hotel,A clean quiet hotel. Close to airport but far from attractions. Close to residential areas.  The bar was limited but had good service.  Below are some pictures i hope it helps your decisions.  Free parking.,Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We hope to welcome you again soon!
Element Miami International Airport,4,Large comfortable room with everything you need,"American Airlines sent us to the Element with vouchers for the stay.  We were surprised with the cleanliness and amenities in our room.  The hotel is very close to the airport with a free shuttle.  Everything was wonderful until we needed the shuttle to take us to the airport to catch our flight.  The driver was busy filling the coffee pots and doing other tasks inside the hotel instead of meeting the scheduled time for the shuttle trip,  This isn't the fault of the driver who was very pleasant but the advertised shuttle schedule was not met.",Thank you for sharing your experience with us! We are sorry to hear that the shuttle schedule was not met during your departure time. We will share your feedback with our team in order to ensure that our shuttle hours are not affected. We hope to welcome you back in the near future should your travels lead to Miami. 
Element Miami International Airport,1,Worst stay we have ever had in a hotel,"The element is the worst hotel experience we have ever had. We were charged THREE times for our hotel stay. Three times over the course of a week!!!. When you're staying 5 nights, that's a lot of money to have go through your credit card and sit there pending. When asked you just get the usual response, it's only authorisation. You should not have that many authorisations for the FULL amount at any time. On top of this, we had to change rooms as our initial one was extremely smelly. Almost like a chemical smell. The second room still had this issue but it wasn't as overwhelming. On top of this, house keeping failed again and again to replace our towels. On both the first and second nights, we arrived to no towels. On the third night, we only had one towel for two people and when","Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We are deeply sorry to hear that your stay here did not meet your expectations. Our hotel is considered an Extended Stay Hotel, our cleaning policies tend to be different from other regular hotels. We apologize if you were not informed of this at the time of check-in. Please feel free to contact Bensen Belfort, the Front Office Manager bbelfort@peachtreehotelgroup.com to further discuss your stay. "
Element Miami International Airport,5,Nice modern hotel,"Close to the airport. Modern rooms that include stand up glass shower, full size fridge, microwave, and stove. Really clean and spacious. Shower had great water pressure, Only downside is that the hotel is a bit far from south beach and ocean drive, about 15 min. All in all I enjoyed my stay and I'll be back. ","Gina Doll A,   We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope that you continue to consider us for your future stays in the area.  Sincerely, "
Element Miami International Airport,1,"Terrible service, terrible food","The room was beautiful, the restaurant was terrible! We received vouchers from American Airlines for this hotel, it came highly recommended.   We thought that missing our flight to Belize because of American Airlines failure to Maintain their planes might have been okay, we had hotel and meal vouchers. We could have a nice dinner, have some Wine and enjoy ourselves.   Turns out, not so much. Yes, the rooms are nice, but the restaurant was Absolutely horrible. We are in Miami, I ordered a Cuban. The worst Cuban I have ever had. I live in Michigan! That's saying something. We are so disappointed, our honeymoon has started off terribly and this hotel just increased our irritation with how poor the quality of food was.    Getting vouchers for a room and 2 Dinners at element was like","adamusru,  Thank you for taking the time to share your experience while staying with us. We are sorry to learn that you were not fully pleased with all aspects of your stay.  We hope that your travels to Belize ended well and we congratulate you on your nuptials.   Sincerely, "
Element Miami International Airport,2,Very Unorganized Hotel,"We had a suite for 2 weeks and it was nothing but one problem after another.  The hall carpets were always dirty and filled with debris.  The rooms were always missing something toilet paper, facial tissue, towels, etc.  The front desk manager was very nice but not effective.  It was like pulling teeth to get the room cleaned every day and 2 days it was never cleaned.  And the breakfast buffet was inadequately stocked and staffed for the hotel size.","BigReviewer2020,   Thank you for taking the time to share your experience while staying at our hotel. We are sorry to learn that we failed to meet or exceed your expectations, for this we sincerely apologize.   "
Element Miami International Airport,3,Not so great,"This is a mediocre business hotel. We were greeted indifferently and with no welcome at the front desk. Had to call down later for the wifi password as it was printed nowhere and not offered at check in. Even my upgraded 1 BR suite lacked basics: no wash cloths, no conditioner in the shower (a combo shampoo and conditioner, yechh), no makeup mirror, no slippers or robe. Handheld shower leaked so much I couldn't use it. The kitchen was adequate but no more. The TVs have a huge lag whenever you change channels — they go black for an excruciatingly long time. Loud AC.   Haven't had the free breakfast yet but I do not have high hopes. Area where it's located appears to be a dead zone with nothing around it.   Definitely my last stay here. ","TravelsWithCharley,  We are sorry to learn that we failed to meet/exceed your expectations during your recent stay with us.  Our goal is to provide each of our guests with a stress free environment while they are away from home.   The issues you described are not typical of our hotel and we would love the opportunity to have you return and see for yourself. Hopefully we can change your mind.   Sincerely,  "
Element Miami International Airport,3,Ok for a brief overnight stay,"Comfortable room and bed plus WiFi and AirPort Shuttle , Buffet breakfast fair but no food available when arrived in the evening from the airport at 7pm so then had to get a taxi to get something to eat .","oblivion,   Thank you for staying with us. We are pleased to learn that you found your room and bed comfortable.  We hope you will consider us again the next time you are in the area.   Sincerely, "
Element Miami International Airport,3,Week Stay,"Stayed for a week with my wife and son.   Clean and nice looking hotel with spacious lobby/public area, good gym, good quality breakfast items. There are desktop computers with internet for public use outside the gym. The room was nice and also clean with a spacious bathroom, kitchen with a coffe machine, toaster, etc. Good king bed, closet. We had no issues with towels and washcloths although we did not have housekeeping everyday of our stay. The front desk personnel were very helpful and polite.  There were no sheets for the sofa bed. During breakfast, it was common to have items running out about 30 minutes before cut off time and one particular morning most items were gone at that time and were not restocked. Seems that they were not equipped to handle the high season that","Jarez71,  Thank you for choosing to stay with us. We are pleased that you enjoyed your room and the assortment of amenities we offer.   Great tip for future guests about the area and their transportation needs. We do offer a complimentary shuttle that goes to and from the airport, as well as, anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the hotel.   Happy New Year!"
Element Miami International Airport,3,Stop over before our cruise,"We were a group of six looking for a room for the night before we left the next day on a cruise.   We arrived at 1 pm, and were fortunate that our rooms were ready for us. Some of us has full kitchen and pull out couch, others just a partial kitchen. Regardless, the rooms were a good size, king beds were very comfortable. The room was reasonably clean, but not spotless. Good size bathroom with a large walk-in shower. Towels were a problem. We had one, others had none. Towels were delivered when requested to all but one room.   The issue with the hotel is that here are few amenities. The restaurant/bar did not open until 5 pm. Beyond the pool and gym there was nothing to do. The hotel is in an industrial area, so we could not even walk to find a shopping centre. Bearing in mind","KimShennan,  Thank you for the review and for choosing to stay with us prior to your cruise.   We would love to have the bar/restaurant open earlier, as many of our guests have made the request. Unfortunately, it is a Marriott standard that we cannot open prior to 5pm. Your comments will be forwarded to the brand in the hopes that we get enough guests asking for it and the brand would be willing to make an exception.   We hope you and your traveling partners had a great cruise!"
Element Miami International Airport,3,Overnight due to delayed flight,"Hotel was clean, room was fine.   No hand towels or wash cloth's in room.  No hair dryer.   No courtesy toothbrush available.   Retail pantry was bare except beverages and tampons.   Would not rate this a category 4 Marriott hotel.  ","260daveb,  Thank you for your comments and for choosing to stay with us. We do apologize for not having additional wash and hand towels, due to the higher than normal amount of families staying with us during this holiday season, we received many more requests from guests to have rooms stocked with extras. It took much longer than we would have liked to collect and wash them.   We hope this does not deter you from visiting us again the next time you are in the area.   "
Element Miami International Airport,5,Fantastic hotel with great service!,"The shuttle driver, Amilio, is the main reason to come here!  Knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, above-and-beyond service.  The proximity to the airport and cruise port, as well as included breakfast, round out this hotel as a top choice. Take advantage of the free shuttle to the nearby Cuban restaurant for lunch...you will not be disappointed!","anekatrina,  Thank you very much for staying with us and for the positive review and score. We are extremely delighted that you enjoyed your time with us and that Emllio made your stay memorable. Your recommendation for the Cuban restaurant will be helpful to future guests.   Sincerely, "
Element Miami International Airport,3,Missed connection in Miami,"Just stayed one night here because a lost connection in the evening at Miami airport.   The room was big and nice, but not clean.  We found a small toy under the bed, no one had cleaned there for sure.  Nice beds, wifi, TV and shower.   Restaurant closed, dont know why.  Walked to their sister hotel like 15 minutes away to get dinner. It was ok.   Bar was open, did not try it. But looked ok.   Shuttle to and from airport ok and free of charge.   Did not had breakfast in the morning since we leaved very early.   The hotel is located out in the middle of nowhere. Nothing around it excepts other hotels as far as we could tell.   Ok for a night.  ","Apeks,   Although we are sorry you were not able to make your connection, we are pleased that we were able to accommodate you for the evening.   Hopefully next time you are in the are, you will be able to stay longer with us.  "
Element Miami International Airport,4,Very nice hotel,"We liked everything about this hotel, very comfortable bed and clean rooms and bathroom. Breakfast was good for being in FL (many hotels we stayed it had worse breakfast). The gym was also nice, the staff friendly.   We wanted to take the shuttle bus from the airport (which is why we chose this hotel) but we would have had to wait 1,5h for the next one so we took a lyft. The receptionist was kind and gave us complimentary snacks to apologize for that. We took the shuttle bus to the Dolphin mall and it worked good, just make sure to see the timetables because it doesn't run so often.","wanillah,  Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for the 4 rating. We are very happy that you enjoyed our rooms, bed, and breakfast.   We hope that you will come stay with us again the next time you are in the area.   Sincerely, "
Element Miami International Airport,4,Perfect Waypoint Stay,"Had a one- night stopover in Miami and chose Element and was pleased. The front desk was efficient and helpful.   The rooms were clean and provided over and above amenities for an abbreviated or even extended stay. There was a small refrigerator, a sink with basic utensils like a fork and knife to eat with, coffee machine with cups, fresh towels, and even a corkscrew for that inevitable bottle of wine from Publix only a 7 minute Uber ride away after a long day of travel.  The beds were clean and comfortable; the bathroom and shower exquisite. Our side of the hotel had a great sunrise over Miami as well.   The rooms were a little warm; granted we came from the Northeast and it was significantly warmer on our arrival, but I think the lowest temp was 68, and the room felt much","rmp153,  Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to write such a detailed review. We are always pleased when our guests share their experiences with us. It helps us identify areas where we can improve.   Happy Holidays."
Element Miami International Airport,4,Good for couple of days,"We went to Miami for our cruise and since flight arrival to Miami was a bit late in the night we have chosen this property and not disappointed, almost full kitchen, clean rooms and basic (As US standard) but functional breakfast, which allow you to pack and carry to your room.  Scheduled airport shuttle, close/walkable to metro/metro bus and Train which connect to FLL airport as well.  No supermarket in walkable distance, need uber to reach the nearest FRESCO, however ""Staybridge""  next to element is providing the free shuttle to this supermarket.","Kaushikdiku,  Thank you for your review and 4 rating. We are pleased that you enjoyed your time with us prior to your cruise.  We hope that your cruise was as enjoyable.   Happy Holidays!"
Element Miami International Airport,1,Worst service ever,"Shuttle never showed, front desk does not answer the phone.Called reservations, the front desk did not answer them either, CSR was very rude. Had to take and Uber after waiting an over an hour.Front desk clerk said they were short staffed, ran out of toothbrushes and meals because they were busy. Carpet was so dirty.this was my second stay this year, it was worst than my first which was pretty bad. Do not stay here!","Andy28B,  Please accept our sincerest apologies for failing to meet or exceed your expectations. The hotel is currently under new management, having taken over just a few recently and we are evaluating all departments and procedures in an effort to improve upon the service and quality offered to the our guests.   Your comments will be of great help in our efforts, and for that we thank you."
Element Miami International Airport,4,Do they truly care about the environment?,"Element has multiple signs and incentives to conserve energy, save water and reuse linens. However there is an appalling waste of single use plastics in their breakfast area. Plastic cutlery, cups, foam plates and food scraps are dumped into a bin labeled recycling. No milk and cream jugs, only little plastic creamers. Really Element, do you care about the environment or are allegedly environmentally supportive initiatives in place to lower your costs. How dare you?!","SSAV3,  Thank you for staying with us and for the 4 rating. As for your concerns over our Green practices, we have a number of initiatives and processes in place that are in support of our environment. Unfortunately, the disposable plates, bowls, and cutlery were a byproduct of the previous management. We are in the process of increasing our inventory on china and silverware so that we can fully phase out the disposable items.   Sincerely,   Hotel Management, "
Element Miami International Airport,5,Always great experience with this Airport Hotel,"Arrived really early in the morning with any hope to get the room immediately but they did give us our room! Not my first time here, but always clean and breakfast is basic but good! Spacious rooms and great customer service.

Element Miami International Airport,1,They Overbooked Me and 26 Others and Left us Sleeping in the Lobby,"That's right. They sold my PREPAID room to someone else and allowed me and 26 other reservations to be without a hotel room. Finally, at 4am, they drove me 30 minutes away to another hotel where they said they would reimburse me for my stay. They didn't. I paid for BOTH hotel rooms and slept in a hotel lobby on a CHAIR UNTIL 4AM IN THE MORNING AND NOW NO ONE WILL CALL MY BACK OR REIMBURSE ME. They don't answer the phones and are avoiding everyone. YES, this is REAL. I am horrified by this treatment. Save yourselves. What a total disaster.","They Overbooked Me and 26 Others and Left us Sleeping in the Lobby,  We are sorry for the experience you had to endure during your visit to our property.

Element Miami International Airport,3,OK for one night.,"Stayed here for one night because of the missed connection. Room was a good size and very clean. Free good speed internet. Arrived around 9 PM. Hotel had no snacks, water, soda  or any kind of food to buy, and no convenience store within a walking distance. That is a significant problem for the hotel which sees a lot of misconnected passengers. There also was  low water pressure in the restroom and shower. Free breakfast was low quality, so I skipped it and eat in the airport instead.","OK for one night,   We apologize for not having our shop fully stocked during your visit. Unfortunately, our food provider missed their scheduled delivery and we experienced a high volume of guests due to canceled flights which depleted our remaining items.  We have since resupplied and are ordering additional items for reserves, so as to not have a repeat occurrence.  Sincerely,   Management"

In addition, I have tried to reach the front desk at the hotel several times, only to get an automated message that no one is available to take my call and I cannot leave a message because the mailbox is full.

Element Miami International Airport,3,"Underwhelmed....,","The Element Hotel is similar to an Aloft .. sleek, minimalist design but more on a Courtyard level of experience. For me, being an Elite Marriott Bonvoy Gold Member for many years.. the combination of the two works out perfectly for my family trip for college touring with my High School Senior.  The room was clean, but there wasn't any bottled water to be found in the hotel, no vending machine , snack store.. nothing . The customer service was minimal.. my son left his toothbrush.. the front desk didn't have extras . The sofa sleeper , when you let it out it touches the TV console , so to get to the restroom you have to step on it to get over it . A real inconvenience.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Beware of double charges,"I prepaid a hotel room in this hotel with getaroom.com.  Upon arrival at this Element Miami International Airport hotel, the agent couldn't find the reservation in the system but assured us the manager would take care of it the following morning when he came in.  Upon checkout the following day we were handed a 0 charge, 0 balance receipt, but a month later the credit card bill showed two charges for the room reservation (one from getaroom.com and one from the Element).  Element agents and managers (as well as getaroom) refused to investigate the issue.  The problem was finally resolved through Better Business Bureau and State Consumer Agency intervention.  We never did find out who was at fault for the double charge, so buyer beware, and keep all of your receipts and","Beware of double charges,   We apologize for any inconveniences that the double billing may have caused you, It is never our intent to needlessly charge a guest extra for services they have already paid for. There are often times that third party reservation sites delay in sending us payment prior to the guests arrival and the reservation appears unpaid in our systems, we then collect payment at the hotel from the guest. When this occurs, the third party is responsible for issuing a refund to the guest since we were never given payment prior to the guests arrival.   I am not sure if this is exactly what occurred during your visit, but we would gladly look into this matter further of you contact us to provide additional details.   Sincerely,   Management"

Element Miami International Airport,1,Airline stay,"We stayed here because our flight was late so AA put us up here.  Tried to call from airport but  no one would answer. Finally got to hotel. Lobby swamped with people.  One person working desk. Go to the bar, The Salon, one woman working bar, restaurant,  waitress.  One person doing all three! People were literally waiting 15-20 mins to get served, pay their bill, get the food they ordered. Our food Sat for 10 mins on counter before we got it. Of course it was cold. There was one patron who sat patiently at bar, bot not saying a word as she would take orders and make drinks for people who came way after him. He finally got up and walked to her and asked if he could please get a drink. She said he has to wait his turn! He'd been there 30 mins. She should be fired.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Shuttle Driver,Emilio was our shuttle driver to the airport. He is passionate about his colleagues and the city.

Element Miami International Airport,2,NEVER EVER AGAIN.  MARRIOTT property NOT UP TO STANDARDS,"Pros: Location right next to airport.  Very little noise even though the planes flew right past the window - close enough to practically see the passengers!  Hotel is clean and has a sleek look in the lobby and the rooms.  Plenty of light. Cons: This hotel is not up to Marriott standards in many ways.  1) Prior to booking, I was told when I called that the price per load of laundry in washers was $2.00.  I planned accordingly and had enough quarters, even though the employee told me that the hotel does have quarters.  We chose this hotel for several reasons, one being that it had self service laundry facilities.  Upon arrival, we learn that the washers were $2.50 each.and that the hotel did not have any more quarters. We had to wait over 2 hours for them to get quarters from","We thank you for sharing your perspective.

Element Miami International Airport,2,"Poor service, AC in room needs service, dog odor","We were placed here overnight by American Airlines. We waited an hour and 15 minutes for shuttle pickup with several people from our flight. We called the desk twice, at 30 mins and an hour to ask about the shuttle. The attendant told us the shuttle was there and we were missing it. We were told by American Airlines the hotel would have convenience items like toothpaste and toothbrush complimentary since we were not allowed to have luggage, but the hotel had none. The room we were given did not cool properly and smelled of dog or dirty feet. We were thankfully only there a few hours. ",Thank you for your feedback. I want to apologize for any inconvenience you experienced during your stay. I will review your comments with the staff involved in your comments to improve the level of service.  
Element Miami International Airport,2,Very Disappointing ,"My family and I overnighted at the Element on the way home and the experience was very poor.  We had a long wait for the shuttle, almost an hour and in the end we called the property and found out that the black Mercedes was not working so we had to look for another van.  After a long day of travelling, the male staff member that checked us in was not very friendly.  We asked about getting something to eat and we were bluntly told that the restaurant was closed and it was too late for the delivery places.  Thankfully another gentleman behind the desk heard his colleague and said it was not too late to order in so we were able to get something to eat.   The room only had towels for 2 when I'd booked a room for 4 persons.  We then had to request linen for the pull out bed.  Then",Thank you for your review.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Ants!!,At first we seconded guessed the hotel due to the location but once we went inside we quickly realized that the outside did not match the inside. Inside you discover a very up to date modern hotel with friendlt staff. Even though staff members seemed friendly we learned not to expect anyone to go out of there way to help with an issue and that we were pretty much on our own when it comes to questions and hotel needs. Our room which was on the second flood was infested with ants and i left the hotel with small bug bits on my body. Upon check out we had to wait over half an hour to check out due to hotel staff arguring with another guest over a lost package and instead of taking the conversation to the side to discuss what was happening in private everyone in the hotel lobby had,Thank you for your feedback.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Will always recommend this hotel when needing to be at Miami International Airport,"This is a great hotel to stay at when needing to be at Miami International hotel. The double bed suite was wonderful with a great full kitchen especially when you have a 15 month old. The staff was very friendly until one during check out day. You need to give Tatiyona some more customer service training or take her off front desk. She is not a people person. Dennis was just starting his shift, but I did not find him friendly or helpful. Those to alone can give you second thoughts about staying there. But just the 2 persons will not stop me coming there. The shuttle drivers are also very nice and accommodating. The manager was not in, but I spoke to Tim Horan who said he part of the visiting management team.","Thank you for your feedback, i appreciate your comments. we hope to see you back at our property soon.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Lacking in a Lot of Areas,"This hotel received a poor rating from me because housekeeping is terrible, and the king bedroom suite (with sofa) I had should have been cleaned more thoroughly before/while I was there.  I stayed in two different suites and one  had all the essentials, while the other one didn't and this was annoying. I had to ask for the basics like soap, dish detergent, utensils, etc.  The rooms are also not soundproof: you will hear the airplanes when they take off. I had to buy some earplugs in order to be able to sleep.  The suite itself was modern and big. The staff was friendly, but clearly overworked. The bed and sofa were comfortable  I got a great deal on my stay so i can't complain too much. I wouldn't stay here and pay full price.",Thank you for your feedback.

I recommend this hotel 100%, it has breakfast included, an excellent patio with a large pool, green areas, it is a pet friendly hotel, and the rooms are very comfortable.

Element Miami International Airport,3,"Impressive, if you don't look too closely","We booked our last minute accommodations at Element after our cruise ship shortened its itinerary due to hurricane Dorian.  We could have selected more reasonably priced accommodations but this one was available and had airport shuttle, cruise terminal shuttle, pool and free breakfast so it appeared to be reasonable. Once booked, I called to arrange the shuttle from the port but was informed they only shuttle to the port, they do not pick up from there. That's my fault, I should have checked before booking. Once our taxi dropped us off, we were impressed with the clean, modern, newly constructed appearance of the facility. The front desk staff were pretty casual but they managed to get us checked in efficiently. Opening the door to our room, we were surprised to find a very","Thank you for sharing your comments with us.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Convenient stay,"I like the Element. Healthy no frills breakfast (complimentary).  Restaurant staff were overwhelmed but very nice and hardworking.  Food was satisfactory there. Best part of the stay was EMILIO the weekend shuttle driver. He was courteous, helpful and very informative! Sweet man.  I had a mobility scooter and he helped load it.  The young man with dark hair at the front desk was apathetic and less than helpful. I asked for a simple bar of soap and that was a huge deal.  I've stayed at Element (different location) before and they do offer bar soap so you don't HAVE to use the dispenser body wash only.  Everyone is was fine.",It was truly a pleasure accommodating you at Element Miami International Airport! We're elated to discover that our suite-style rooms continue to provide you with plenty of room to spread out and get comfortable.

Element Miami International Airport,4,"Great service and amenities for the price, dodgy neighborhood ","No one books an airport hotel for the outdoor space... but it's really not a great surrounding neighborhood.  The hotel itself is clean and modern, with a full service restaurant and complimentary breakfast and "" afternoon reception "" snacks. Has a good gym, pool and laundry which I needed.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Not a good customer experience we left. ,"My wife and I were returning to the hotel after a cruise.  We stayed the week before and were quite happy.    This visit was different - we arrived early and were very happy to get an early check in from the Pleasant young lady at the desk.    We went to our room which was very cold, but we were happy to drop our bags and head of the the mall.  We turned the temp to 71 before leaving.   When we returned late in the afternoon the room was warmer but so damp that the floor was slippery and wet. My wife also noticed and unpleasant Oder.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Cruise Travel,We stayed here twice one day prior to our cruise and the day after our cruise. First the really great thing is the shuttle. We were able to get to and from the airport with ease. Our driver Emilio was the best. He was friendly and informative and offered us water on the ride to the hotel. The shuttle on cruise day which was apart of the room package we got was on time that being said they wanted us to Uber back when we got off the boat and we did. The Staff for the most part were wonderful They were accommodating by keeping our luggage until check in as were early and decided to spend the day touring and shopping. They would have paid for the Uber back but I didn't submit the receipt as requested so that's on me. apparently it's very hard to coordinate the return to the hotel,"Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback, and I appreciate your kind compliments for our courteous staff.

The Airline gave me a voucher for The Element. By the time I arrived, it was after midnight and I was exhausted.   I handed the front desk my voucher and was informed that they were completely full and had no available rooms.  I was devastated and broke into tears.   They explained that the Airline has been sending them other refugees all evening without letting the hotel staff know.    After a moment, they decided to put in a suite.  I am sure the voucher only covered a regular room.   I thanked them for that. Then, I asked them if they had a toothbrush and toothpaste, they said they were all out.  I had to wait until I got to the airport in the am and buy one.   My review is for 3",We are grateful for your feedback.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Not bad for an airport hotel,"Stayed here  and this was pretty nice for a hotel airport. Location is super convenient. The suite is nice. Bathrooms are pretty clean, but the conditioner was out on our shower and hadn't been replaced. Room service was hard to track down at night.  They do provide shuttles to the airport which is nice and complimentary wine and cheese downstairs which wasn't half bad. The bed was comfortable.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Very convenient location,This was our second time staying at this hotel and I love that the hotel shuttle comes to get us from the airport. The shuttle comes to the airport every 30 minutes for pickups and to drop you off also. Emellio our shuttle driver was very polite and friendly. He even took us to the bus station when we asked. The shuttle can also drive you to close by places-not just the airport  the bus station is actually walking distance from the hotel -maybe a 1/2 mile walk. From there If  you want to go to the beach you can take the 150 bus and if you want it'll take you all the way down to the end of south beach by the pier almost.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Airport what Airport!,"The soundproofing in the hotel is the best I have ever encountered. When you are in the hotel you don't even realize you are literally at the end of the runway. Inside the hotel is quiet, outside is extremely loud but to be expected. If you are sitting on the patio or in the pool you can't carry on a conversation when a plane takes off, you can look up and see people through the windows it's so close. There is also absolutely no shade by the pool so it can be very hot, an umbrella or 2 would help a lot.

The check in staff weren't overly welcoming, the breakfast was average but good for something quick to eat if you needed to leave early for a flight. The bed was comfortable, room was clean, however the room seemed very damp?! Maybe because there was no extractor fan in the bathroom.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Short stay May 2019,"Nice clean modern décor, friendly staff, wonderful managers welcome in the evenings.  Salty and sweet , nice pairings.  The only thing that made it unpleasant was the extra $20.00 to park our car at the hotel we were paying to stay at.  Where would you suggest someone to park their car?  Certainly not on the street where we were told it is unsafe to do so.  Took a little enjoyment out of our stay.  Other than that the experience was enjoyable.  We took a walk along the banks of the canal, watched the airplanes fly over so close you felt you could touch them.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Very good hotel. Right next to the airport. Offers complimentary shuttle to MIA,"I really liked this hotel, it is very clean, offers a kitchenette with Microwave, fridge (even a corkscrew!) Room looked recently refurbished and bed was very comfy. The only minor downside to the overall experience was the service at the front desk, there was a male person in there that did not know very well what he was doing. Luckily a lady named Winchelle was there to save the day and squared our issues straight away.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Layover,"Great airport hotel. Emilio was the highlight, he drives the shuttle but could easily be a manager!  He knows so much about the hotel amenities, telling us everything we could benefit from during our stay, noting the hours of the pool, gym, breakfast, shuttle departures, etc.  The rooms are spacious and comfy. I needed maintenance for my TV and Juan came up quickly and got me taken care of. Great service all around.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Simple And Nice,Usually stay at this Element location every October and what stands out is the willingness of staff to assist guests. Staff is mostly Latin American and the rooms are of good size with all the essentials and conveniences. They have a ‘go green' theme which I appreciate and breakfast is usually nice. There's also some kind of happy hour with wine etc and a shuttle service which goes out of its way to get you from point A-B and to the mall as well.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Stay,"I was really delighted, the minute I walked into the hotel.  The lobby gave me a feeling of cleanliness.  Once arriving at the desk, we were met by Dwight Marais, who topped it all.  He was so very friendly, making the registration process quick and completely painless.  The rooms were absolutely beautiful.  We were only there for one night; and sorry we weren't staying for a whole week.

Element Miami International Airport,5,New look same warmth.,"It's been 4 years since we used this hotel every time we visited Miami. It even served as a refuge when we needed it the most.  We enjoyed the pleasant surprise of the improvements made to the hotel. It looks very elegant and modern. But for us, the best thing about this hotel is the human resource. At the reception we always receive the warm hospitality of everyone, especially Yamil, Bensen, Dwight and Alejandro. Breakfast now has a more varied selection of meals for adults and for our children. In addition, we find more nutritious alternatives, especially if you are controlling the consumption of gluten and sugar. I congratulate Iliana, Linda, Yadary and Margarita, as they maintain a very good attitude and are always willing to please our taste and requests even with the busy","From start to finish, we hope all of our guests feel just the same when they stay with us.

Element Miami International Airport,2,"Rooms are great, service not so much","Tried to check in early, was told check in doesn't start till 3pm. Let the Rep know that our hotel booker made made arrangements, he proceeded to say they don't do that, but what's your name. After looking and seeing the notes, he said ""oh your our VIP guest, here's your room card"". If you have rooms available, don't make guest wait. The same Rep made another person from our group wait until she asked him again and he checked. The rooms are comfortable, big and nice. I didn't like that I stayed from early Thursday and left Saturday and my room didn't get cleaned. We did not have the do not disturb sign on, so we had to call the front desk with my cell phone, since the room phone didn't work and ask for more towels. Breakfast was not good either.

Element Miami International Airport,4,"Location, location, location!","Beautiful hotel with convenient location to the airport. Had some confusion at check in as we had vouchers for our 4 rooms which were prepaid via Bedsonline. Manager had to assist the desk staff.  Also, taxi driver did not know by this name as it is a Westin property.   One of the rooms had broken AC unit, so relocated to a new room when they could not repair. Super clean throughout. Nice pool. Lots of airline crews stay here. Nice Happy Hour in the lobby with beer/wine and cheese/fruit/crackers. Plenty of parking.","An overall great stay is just what we want our guests to experience!

Element Miami International Airport,4,"Beautiful, one weakness","This is a beautiful hotel, with beautiful lobby and great rooms. Unfortunately it is located in a not so ideal location, but it is close to the airport and not far from the AMTRAK station. Its only weakness is food service, which is significant. The restaurant and its menu are terrible and the breakfasts are abhorrent. Hopefully, now that Marriott has purchased the property this will improve significantly.","We thank you for staying with us and appreciate your feedback.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Extremely clean hotel!!!,I checked into the hotel on March 26th and i was amazed. This hotel is immaculate and i loved everything about it.

Element Miami International Airport,1,"Terrible, Horrible Service, Took my Money, and No Room","This hotel recently gave me the single worst travel service in my 20+ years of independent travel and booking on the internet.  I recently reserved and paid for a room (via AMOMA) for an overnight stay at Miami Element Hotel. We were issued a voucher and confirmation and were charged. The room was paid for IN FULL in advance.  Arriving at the hotel, after a late flight, with my wife and five year old child, the hotel claimed to have no record of our booking, said they were full. The desk clerk offered no recourse or apology of any sort. After saying this, in fact, he then left the desk and did not speak to us again for the next half hour as we sat dumbfounded in the lobby desperately trying to find a last minute place to stay.  I immediately contacted AMOMA's customer service","Good morning,   We want to sincerely apologize for the inconveniences that you experienced in regards to your reservation. Your experience is not consistent with our reservation procedures or the level of service we pride ourselves on. You mentioned that you booked through AMOMA which is a third party.

If there is anything we can do to alleviate the situation, please contact us directly. Your feedback is important in ensuring that all concerns are addressed appropriately.  "
Element Miami International Airport,1,Unprofessional,"We had 2 rooms for 2pm check out. In the first room they came by 3 times to see if we left so our sleep was interrupted. In the second room the maid threw away our food we brought all the way from the Caribbean. When I tried to get information from her she said ""Spanish only"".This is unacceptable.","Andy,   Thank you for reaching out to us.  Your experience is not consistent with our housekeeping procedures or the level of service we pride ourselves on. I am truly sorry if we somehow fell short. Your feedback is important and we regret that this was not evident from the start. Our guests' satisfaction is greatly important to us and we ask that you reach out directly if you would like to discuss your visit further.   "
Element Miami International Airport,1,"Terrible Service, No Follow up","I stayed here at the beginning of the month and left a jacket in my room. I called the hotel the next day to follow up on my missing item with promises of a follow up. I received no follow up. I have emailed the hotel several times with no response to my issue. I have called again only to be put on hold for 30 minutes. I still don't know whether my item is in their possession or has be "" lost "". Their lack of service is not acceptable for any hospitality business in this age when there are so many hotels to choose from in the area. Do not book here as they clearly do not care enough about their business to ensure that their guests' satisfaction following their stay. The are completely unorganized as also witnessed at checkin. I will never be staying here again.","Hello Nicole,   First off, I wanted to thank you for your feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We take our guest reviews very seriously so that we are able to improve each and every one of your experiences.

From there, they document what room it came from and it goes into a locked cabinet until we receive a description of the item from the guest.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Very good even for us old people!; A few glitches,"This Marriott brand seems aimed at millennials or other young people, but we old folks really liked it!!!!!    The whole vibe of the hotel is modern and young.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was an unexpected treat.  We did get there on the airport shuttle, and had no problem-----I was in a wheelchair due to a broken bone and so the wait at MIA was unpleasant, but we only waited 15 or 20 minutes (which is reasonable since we were told the shuttle is every half hour).    We really loved the bathroom.  I do agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned that the hot water took forever (at least one minute or more) but the spaciousness of the bathroom and particularly the shower made up for that minor inconvenience.  Too many hotel bathrooms have that bath/shower combination and","Hello cessnapilot,  Thank you for taking the time to post your review, and thank you as well for your multiple favorable comments regarding our Hotel and its services.  We have shared and address the issues you mention as a couple of negatives. Thanks you again for your review and for your business. I am very glad that we could be of service."
Element Miami International Airport,1,Really not professional ,"If you book this hotel, please be prepared to wait for the airport shuttle. It took us 1 hour. But even worse, we were given linens to prepare the sofa bed by ourselves. The staff is very polite but we are under the impression they don't really care about us.","We value your feedback and want to thank you for taking the time to share your comments.

Element Miami International Airport,5,IHG Rewards Man,"My family and I stayed at this property from 2-20-19 to 2-27-19 while visiting family in the Miami area.  The accommodations were wonderful and very clean.  I had a chance to meet the general manager and front desk manager who were true hospitality professionals.  During the stay, activities included a trip to the Miami Everglades, a spring training baseball game (including catching a baseball), and trying a variety of new foods.  Upon check out, the front desk manager invited our family back for any future travel needs.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Near place .... nice work out room .... very selective TV stations,"I stayed here for 2 nights.     Hotel was clean and the rooms were nice.    Very unique vibe that I enjoyed  My only complaint is the work out facility for some reason has a very limited number of channels to watch.    They give you a "" watch list "" but channels 2 thru 44 (75% of the list are blocked).    I tried asking at the front desk and a "" director "" said he could not help or explain.....  If you are not working out... great spot.... if you are working out .... find a different place","Hello jeffbG119LM,  Thank you for your feedback.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Below average,"I checked into the Element Miami for a one night stay for business.   I chose the hotel due to its proximity to the airport. It look like a nice new trendy hotel.   The staff was friendly and the hotel has the potential to be very nice. However, when I went into my room I looked at the floor it obviously not been swept from swept from the previous occupant. There was a sheet metal screw on the floor next to the air conditioning room in the bedroom.  There was absolutely no water pressure in the sin,  it took the water five minutes to get hot. I understand water saving appliances and hotels commitment to saving water however if I run the water three times as long just to get some hot water with no pressure what does it really save.  I came down to the lobby at 6:20 in the","We value your feedback and want to thank you for taking the time to share your comments.

Element Miami International Airport,3,"Cold breakfast, great rooms","Hotel room was lively, comfortable, well designed. BUT I  always wonder how breakfasts obtain great reviews when the eggs are cold and the sausages are sitting on the side barely under a heat lamp.  Also how does this property have a Trip Advisor green award at silver level when breakfast was served on single use styrofoam plates with plastic cutlery.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Decent Hotel That Misses the Mark on Extended Stay Amenities.,"King - Guest Room. 300s. Good view of pool and lake.   Room: Clean. Linens and bedding are dated/old but also clean. Room is eco-friendly: filtered water on tap, eco friendly lighting, and very low water pressure in sinks and shower. My biggest frustration with the room: the hotel website promises that rooms are equipped with a kitchenette for a convenient extended stay: stovetop, microwave, pots, pans, salt/pepper, etc. My room only had an old microwave and toaster as heat sources, and a tiny fridge with very limited space for groceries. Definitely not the promised ""fully equipped kitchenette"" for an extended stay.  Location: hotel is incredibly close to the Miami Airport which makes it very convenient to get to and from airport. However, the closeness to the airport means you","Thank you for your detailed review, m_on_safari. We appreciate you taking the time to express your opinion throughout various items on our property.  While the room you stayed in did not offer the full kitchenette, we do offer full kitchens in most of our room inventory. We offer a small amount of Standard room types- the one you stayed in- for guests who do not need the full kitchen. It might have been that the room type booked was not our Studio rooms but instead our Standard type. I apologize that it was not what you expected. I am glad to hear you enjoyed the proximity of our property to the airport, as well as our full continental breakfast with various options for your early morning meal.  We hope you will allow us the opportunity to welcome you back in the future, and you may experience the full Element extended stay potential.  Thank you!"

Element Miami International Airport,3,Nice place stay - too bad front desk assistance when we arrived in Miami was missing,"Element is a very nice hotel. PROS: Good breakfast, great shower, spacious room CONS: We arrived in Miami for the first time, stranded at the airport because we tried to call the hotel and no one would answer for at least an hour. We should have used Uber but we had never used that service before. Shuttle to Cruise port was not their usual driver and it was touch and go how badly he drove in traffic. The bright lights across the street came in and hard to sleep because shade wouldn't go down completely.","Thank you for sharing your insight.

It has a shuttle and the front desk is friendly.  If you're a Platinum member, you get a few goodies at check-in. Not much nearby though.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Good Business Stay,"I stayed for a week + weekend on business. The happy hour is a nice touch with local beer and fun staff. The gym is fantastic, a lot of equipment. The rooms are kind of like an extended stay, the kitchen has your basics to cook. The neighborhood is a junkyard, no where to eat and grubhub takes an hour. So plan accordingly. The wifi worked perfectly, the bed was a bit hard for me. Never saw anyone in the pool, even on the weekend. The breakfast was basic, but good, no meat that I saw.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Element Miami,"Great Hotel to be at while in Miami. Price was good, room was absolutely amazing (306) and the two queen beds were probably the best sleep i have had in a while.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Great Hotel Close to Airport,"My family arrived off of a cruise ship VERY early to the Element, and while there were no rooms ready yet - there were plenty of places to sit inside and out and relax. They also allowed us to enjoy the breakfast that was out. The staff was very kind and helpful and were working very hard on this day as it seemed the hotel was full.

Element Miami International Airport,4,A surprise,"Our first experience of this brand - but thanks to American airlines late incoming aircraft - here we are. Our first impression was not good. We cannot understand why the receptionist could not hand out a key in exchange for the voucher. With 15 folk on the shuttle, checkin at 00.30h took half an hour - not appreciated. The room was fine and quiet and we slept well, but the free breakfast finished at 09.30, before we could sample it. But American Airlines had given us food and beverage vouchers, but no outlet where they could be used was available. We wanted to check out at 14.00 but felt the $50 extra charge to be unjustified. In fairness, if i had to spend a week there, it would be fine, with a fully fitted kitchen.","Thank you for your recent recount of your stay with us. We understand how frustrating it may be as a passenger with unexpected flight changes. It is our goal to ensure your check in experience, as well as your food options are readily available.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Very convenient for Miami Airport,Our family of seven spent one night in the Element Miami Airport Hotel.

It was about the same, the a loft seems a little cleaner and fresher despite of the load annoying music always playing.   This location did have breakfast included which was nice.

Element Miami International Airport,5,"A beautiful, friendly place to stay!","I was fortunate enough to stay at the newly remodeled Element Hotel on January 13, 2019.  Every single employee I encountered was friendly, professional, helpful, and seemed happy that I was staying there,  Although everyone was wonderful, I was able to get the names of four: Rafaela and Ariel in the Salon;  Winchelle at the front desk, and the front office manager, Bensen.   The Salon has great pub food and an indoor and outdoor seating area.  Ariel and Rafaela were superb with their service, attention to detail, and conversation.  I would have loved to have stayed longer at the Element, and will definitely stay there again!","Barbara,  Thank you very much! It's humbling to receive such high praise. A happy guest is our ultimate goal, so it's great to hear that you so enjoyed your extended stay with us.

It would be a true pleasure to welcome you back to Element Miami International Airport next time you are in the area."
Element Miami International Airport,5,Bar at element Miami airport hotel,Rafaela at the bar was awesome. I couldn't have asked for a nicer more helpful person. The bar was very nice and conveniently located very close to the airport. The hotel has been recently remodeled and look very upscale and chic.,"Javell,   We love that you were so well impressed with our associates' service here at Element Miami International Airport.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Surprise!,I was here a year ago and to my surprise when I arrive I found the hotel had been recently renovated.   Stayed in town due to several meetings I had scheduled and the Hotel is perfect for those professionals that need a secure clean place to stay while in town for business. Noticed the personnel is attentive and kind as always! So that is the only thing that I found the same.  I enjoyed the gym every morning before I went out and during the afternoons the sparkling pool. I highly recommend this special place!,"Frances,  We strive to maintain the highest level of service, hospitality and comfort for our guests, so we were very happy to read that your stay at Element Miami International Airport was such a positive experience.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Great stay!,"This was our first visit to the Element. Overall, a terrific stay. Some of the highlights were the comfortable room, and bed in particular. The rooms have a full kitchen on top of everything else.  The Internet connection was top notch. They put on a very nice breakfast each morning. They offer a free happy hour, which we saw only in passing, but appeared to be well received. Great gym. They even have a laundry room.  We were concerned that the noise from the international airport just adjacent to the hotel would be an issue, but it was not at all! Very quiet hotel. Terrific staff. Would go back in a flash.","Thank you for sharing your experience. We are thrilled that we have exceeded your expectations. Your compliments are so appreciated.  Our comfortable and spacious rooms, with full kitchens make it very convenient for our guests to use during their time here.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Great Convenient Overnight Stop,"We stayed here on a night stop to break our long journey and it proved an excellent choice.  The room was very spacious with wonderfully comfortable beds, and all the facilities you might need if you wanted to self cater.  Good bathroom with lovely shower and the whole hotel looked fresh and newly renovated.  Breakfast was a bit limited but is complimentary with the room rate and enough to fortify us for the onward flight the following morning.  The shuttlebus to and from the airport runs every 30 minutes and was quick and reliable.  The journey is no more than 10 mins and friendly service.  We loved the pool which was great for a refreshing dip after a long flight, and equally lovely for a morning swim.  There is some plane noise but this is inevitable with a hotel so close to","It is wonderful to read that you enjoyed our property throughout your journey.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Hit or miss,"This hotel is either a real hit or a real miss based upon who you are fortunate enough, or unfortunate enough, to have as staff.  The morning we were lucky and had great staff....great shuttle service.  The evening staff was far less with bad staff experiences.  The rooms are great...the breakfast area was a dysfunctional mess when we were there.  This may be due to lack of staffing.  Overall, recommend if you aren't staying long and dont need to interact with the staff very much....if consistent service is something you are looking for then recommend going elsewhere.","Dear Guest,    Thank you for choosing to stay at the Element Miami International Airport and providing your honest feedback on the Guest Satisfaction Survey.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Great room,We booked this hotel prior to a cruise.  The room was very clean and modern and on trend.  The bed was so comfortable.  We enjoyed the continental breakfast that was included in the price.  We did do dinner in the Salon that was a little disappointing.  My Cuban sandwich was overdone and hard to bite. My husband's club sandwich was good.  The neighborhood is not the greatest.  Be mindful when going out especially at night.  We used Uber to the cruise port for $6.30.,"Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts.  We are delighted that you found our hotel inviting with our clean, welcoming and modern style. Our Westin Heavenly beds are definitely a favorite among our guests. I am so sorry that our service at the Salon were not up to par.  I will certainly share this feedback with my team.

Element Miami International Airport,5,My stay,I have been staying at the Element Miami International Airport for a little over a year now and my stay experience has only gotten better over time. The welcome is ALWAYS professional yet super friendly. The staff at the front desk have ALWAYS been very helpful and are always willing to go above and beyond to make sure everything is ok. The house keeping staff are also very friendly and welcoming and sometimes even insist a little bit on making sure that the room is up to your standard and comfort. From time to time I even get hello hugs which is always refreshing . On holidays they go out of their way to ensure that we as guest (my colleagues and I) feel the comfort of home away from home. i am proud to call the Element Miami International Airport my home away from home and,"Thank you so much for your kind remarks, Samathra.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Excellent Staff and Atmosphere,"I stay at the Element quite frequently and it is more like home and family than my real home is, likely because I stay there more. The management and staff are friendly and accommodating and have every guest's interests at heart to make for a great stay. In addition the rooms are spacious and clean and well stocked with the means to cook in if so desired. There has also been remodeling of late, not that the previous rooms really needed it. It is just the corporate effort to stay top notch.  My favorite staff member has to be the bartender Rafaela, as she is not only very good at her job, but also is always smiling and helpful with going the ""extra mile"" whenever necessary. Overall, I would highly recommend the Element anytime while in Miami.",We can't thank you enough for sharing such a glowing review and for your gracious praise for our hotel.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Home Away from Home!!!!!!,"It is with a sincere heart that I extend a warm appreciation to the Element Hotel Miami International Airport for their home away from home accommodation and continued first class hospitality. The recent interior décor changes would place a smile on anyone's face. The smell of fresh paint and the interior changes to the rooms entertained the thought of "" repainting and decorating your home for the Christmas Holidays "". Being in the aviation industry for over five (5) years I've had the pleasure of staying at many hotels across the globe, none of which I've ever felt the most at home like the Element.   My recent stay was by far the best!!

Element Miami International Airport,4,Element overview ,First time at the Element Hotel. The staff are friendly and extremely hospitable.   The living quarters are clean and spacious and allow for extended stays with washing and drying facilities for guest use.  Outdoor swimming pool to be able to take advantage of the Florida sun and a well equipped gym served me well. There is a man made fire Pitt which is perfect for having a drink around on impromptu nights.   Happy hour Monday to Thursday 5:30pm to 7pm consists of free wine/beer and cheese. It's a nice touch and an incentive for guests to not feel like the only space to hang out is their rooms.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Good value for money and near the Metro Link,"This all suites hotel offers guest a full kitchen and all other luxery ameneties, decent complimentary breakfast buffet, swimming pool, gym and above all great front office staff. The manager on duty was very helpfull in solving an issue I had. Alejandro, front desk supervisor did a terrific job in communicating with him in order to resolve my problem.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Greeted with a $22 parking fee instead of a welcome drink!,"Element Miami Airport used to be a friendly laid back hotel with a wonderful staff who made sure frequent guests received their welcome drink and knew about their evening snack.  Now they bait you in flashing an $85 rate and whack you with a $22 parking fee that surprises old guests and makes everyone feel nickeled and dimed.  This fee applied even to gold and platinum SPG members.  "" Its not our problem, Marriott told us to do it they bought SPG "" the front desk said.    30% of clients are now parking on the street.  To sum this up, the parking fee amounts to a surcharge of over 30% of the $84 flash rate.  So keep that in mind when pricing hotels at Miami Airport— many chains continue to offer free parking as this hotel used to.  What next?  A resort charge?  Nickels and diming","Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We regret you were not made aware of our parking charge prior to your arrival. Please know that we do offer hotel packages that include parking. When booking through a third party, it is important to fully review the hotel you have chosen. Our parking rates are noted on our website. It is regrettable that your comments do not reflect the true level of service we strive to provide.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Could be better,"Spotty Wi-Fi. Internet connection has serious issues. TV's and Cable OUT OF DATE. At least on the First floor.  Customer Service is average. Shuttle service provided, but only within 3 mile distance of hotel. Not helpful. Parking availability during full hotel booking is terrible.  Events in lobby for guest should be more frequent.  Staff during food service (breakfast) are eager to end service early.","Thank you for sharing your feedback.  I am truly disheartened that you did not enjoy your stay here with us.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Service is one of the worst I have had,"My stayed was on August 13th 2018. I made some purchases on amazon and I was supposed to pick them up at the hotel. Long story short, not all the packages were in the hotel. I kindly asked further assistance to send me the packages to one address and I was going to take the charge on that, no issue. They gave 4 different instructions, to fill a credit card authorization, to send a prepaid fedex label, to ask a friend to pick them up and wait for next trip....  Teo weeks later, I do not even know where my packages are, the hotel now are telling me they don't have records of any package under my name Michelle is not taking any ownership telling me she does not know and is not responsible for what Karen told me. 0 ownership.

Element Miami International Airport,5,General Manager Vincent was AWESOME!,I've stayed here twice and it was a night & day difference! The first time we stayed here was a disaster because of the customer service BUT I liked the layout of the hotel so we decided to give it another try since they said it was under new management and man was there a huge difference!  My family & I stayed here about a month or so ago and the customer service was excellent! We got a chance to meet the General Manager Vincent and I then understood why the hotel had made such a drastic change in customer service. He took the time to talk to us and apologized for our previous experience and assured us that the customer service was their first priority. This made our experience much better than the first one we had. Vincent and his staff made it one of the best experiences,"Thank you for your wonderful compliments of Element Miami International Airport, and of Vincent. He is truly an exceptional person, and we are very lucky to have had him. Your comments will definitely brighten up his day.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Overnight stay,"Just stopped overnight prior to a cruise from Port Miami,  Check in easy and staff was friendly and welcoming,  The hotel and room were modern and comfortable.  I chose this place specifically because we were arriving in the evening and it had a restaurant,  The food was good-but there was only  one employee serving as bartender and wait staff. The area was busy. I know she did the best she could but she was alone.  Great overnight stay. Will visit again ","Thank you so much your kind review. We are happy to know you were able to experience great service in our Salon restaurant, despite the circumstances presented. It is our pride and joy in our work environment that drives us to exceed in our daily routines. We hope to welcome you back soon!"
Element Miami International Airport,2,Nice room with dirty carpet,The hotel looks like it may be newer. The carpet in the halls is filthy. Even the room had a big area rug that was nasty and stained. Looks like the hotel isn't properly maintained by housekeeping and other staff. Check in was ok. Girl ran my card twice for incidentals. Pool was nice enough. Advice would be to bring sandals when walking in your room. ,Thank you for taking your time to write a review about your recent stay. I apologize on behalf of our staff for any inconvenience you might have experienced during your time here. I hope you will give us another chance when returning to Miami!
Element Miami International Airport,4,Nice hotel,"We were staying at this hotel for 3 nights, it was perfect for us because we came to this place by plane and we are going to another by bus (and Megabus and Grayhound bus station are in walking distance). Hotel is cute, very clean and personnel is nice, the only minus is a noise from the planes because airport is nearby..   Also, what is also great - Miami Beach is 20-25 minutes by express bus from the nearby bus station. Also, there is metro train to downtown Miami which is also round 20 minutes - and that is great (on google maps it may seem longer distance but actually it's faster than Uber).

Element Miami International Airport,4,Good airport hotel in convenient and quiet location ,"Element Miami Int'l Airport hotel is very conveniently located - it‘s a 5 min walking distance from the RCC saving you the wait for the shuttle or the trip with a Taxi.  Despite its location it's rather quiet - of course you hear the airplanes but they won't fly between midnight and 6am.  Rather new hotel according to the elements style. Large and comfortable rooms - very clean.  Complementary breakfast with a good choice of cereals, roasts, bagels, pancake.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Far more than a holding tank,"Many hotels near airports are just holding tanks, with a too casual attitude towards their customers whom they are unlikely to see again.   This is not one of those hotels and excels in many areas.   I have now stayed here twice,  once for two nights and this time for one night, but really I wouldn't mind an extended stay here. The rooms are spacious so you can open suitcases without having to step over them to go from bathroom to bed. There's a refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher, iron and board, and safe.  There's a terminal on the desk with USB power and HDMI input for the TV. There is a Blu Ray player, but the HDMI allows you to watch a movie through your pc.

Element Miami International Airport,4,"A very nice place near the airport, but. Lost a little of its glow over the years.","I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past years.  The hotel is showing some wear and tear, probably from its high occupancy.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Stuck at the airport in Miami on a standby flight!!,My daughters and i were stuck at the Miami airport flying standby to St Maarten. RCI helped connect me with the Element Hotel. They had a shuttle that ran us back and forth to the airport. The airport shuttle ran every 30 minutes 24 hours a day. They also had a shuttle that woudl take you anywhere within 3 miles. This was good for food and to go to a nearby store. It was not going to get you to the beach or downtown area though. The shuttle drivers we SOOO nice! The front desk was moderately helpful But DWIGHT the supervisor was exceptionally HELPFUL. I ended up extending my day bc the flights were full. He got me the lowest rate he could for the next night which was A LOT better price than RCI helped me obtain. I would recommend going to the Element and asking for a supervisor,"Thank you for taking the time to share your impressions of the time spent at our hotel. We are delighted that you enjoyed our on-site amenities, and the convenience of our airport shuttle. We understand that the little details can make a big difference in a guest's stay, so we are constantly striving to provide the very best service to our guests.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Roomy Rooms,"I stayed at the Element Hotel for 5 days. Very clean and comfortable room. Close to the airport, but has great soundproof so not an issue. The hotel is well located and practical with all the right amenities. As modern as the setting was, it was the staff that really made it a worthwhile place to stay, especially Mr. Jeff the manager, who gave impeccable dining recommendations. There's is a good restaurant on site, but I wasn't going to eat there every night. I did not use the pool but it look pretty. Overall, I'll recommend it to anyone visiting the Miami area.","Thank you for letting Element Miami International Airport provide you with a wonderful stay.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Disappointing Visit ,"Arrived Friday 06th July for one night, upgraded room. These rooms are great with kitchenette. Couple of things, phone in bedroom broken, phone on desk didn't work, aircon was very noisy.   Second day I was sat by the pool, there were four families in the pool, with children playing nicely and having fun.   However one family in particular felt it necessary to shout at one another, two children almost shouting at the tops of their voices and the mum was shouting back and forth with them.   In the end I politely said do you need to shout at one another? Yes you can probably guess how that went down, "" This is how we speak, don't like it, then leave "" The family actually arrived after everyone else.   I said is there the need to shout though? There are other families in the pool and","Thank you for sharing your insight.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Last minute booking due to cancelled flight,Booked the Element through a 3rd party booking Agent. The night before due to BA cancelling our flight home. We were very impressed by the hotel. Very modern and spacious rooms.  We had our evening meal at the hotel. Not a very extensive menu but food was very good. Asked for a late checkout next day which was granted free of charge. On checking out we paid the bill which was $85.04 for our meal and drinks charged to our room. I made sure that they had not charged for the room as it was pre paid through 3rd party agent. Having been home a few days received my MasterCard bill and have been charged by the hotel $83.50 also. Have emailed with no response. This is disappointing. I would have given the hotel a higher score if not for this problem and would make me think twice about,Thank you for reaching out to us.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Excellent Stop for Weary Travelers,"We were diverted to this hotel by an airline delay and were very tired and in a different city than we expected.  Though we arrived late and near restaurant closing the staff was very accommodating and provided a hot meal.  The front desk staff was very helpful with an internet difficulty.  The room was spacious and clean and up to date, with comfortable bed. The morning included breakfast was more than expected with individual omlette maker. Because we had an evening flight overseas the staff accommodated us with a later check out.  Also the shuttle driver was very friendly and welcoming.  All in all a very good experience for an unexpected airline glitch.","Thank you for choosing the Element Miami International Airport for your recent travels to Miami.  Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Lacking in customer service,"For a quick overnight stay between flights - the element is a decent choice. Unfortunately, in the 16 short hours we were there, we encountered a few hiccups. I'll start with the positives...  The good: comfy bed, spacious room and nice complimentary breakfast. We had dinner at the Salon Restaurant - the food was good and the service speedy - despite being very busy. The wait staff however, did not know how to split the bill among two credit cards - apparently they had a new system and they were still learning the ropes. We ended up putting the entire charge on my friends card.  The not-so-good: 1) a fair amount of wear and tear in the room ... wobbly chairs, nicked furniture, stained sofa.  2) If your flight is arriving at peak times (8pm in our case), do not expect to catch","Thank you for taking the time to reach out and let us know about your recent experience, as your feedback is invaluable to us.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Always a great place to stay!,"We arrived at MIA late in the evening from an overseas flight and the shuttle (free) was right there to get us.  After a very short trip to the hotel, we were greeted, as always with open arms and a wonderful room.  This is the third Element Hotel at which we have stayed, and it is just as great as the ones before.  Wonderful room, bed and full kitchen awaited our key entry.  Up to date furnishings, full prepared free breakfast, snacks and beverages at manager's reception and always fruit and coffee in the lobby all day long. They even have bicycles to borrow if you feel ambitious.  Wonderful pool and workout room for the visitors...You can't go wrong!","We can't thank you enough for sharing such a glowing review and for your gracious praise for our hotel.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Outrageous parking fee and low customer service,"I stayed at the Element Miami Airport hotel from 6/15/18-6/18/18. I am very dissatisfied with a couple of things. 1. Parking $20 a day: Everyday my 2 kids and I had to park at the end because your employees take up the front ones, making unloading and loading very difficult. That is ridiculous. 2. There was construction all around the hotel making it very difficult to get to the hotel in the first place. The roads that did eventually lead to the hotel were all flooded. 3. My room smelled like old water. A very strong smell as soon as you walked in. 4. The sofabed was very difficult to close, it would get very stuck. My husband almost got his arm stuck trying to close it. 5. There was a $50 refundable deposit that was not stated at ALL during booking or check in.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Bad experience,I was originally staying at the Element Doral and decided to extend my stay with my family - mistakenly booked Element Miami International Airport instead. Tried to call MIA Int Airport to transfer my reservation to Doral where I was already settled in but they basically refused to do so.  I tried to call front desk but their manager was not available. Apparently she was also working alone which is ridiculous. Normally front desk staff would have at least two people in office. I would know because I was once employed as front desk staff.   Anyways so I was left with no choice but to move everything to Element MIA Int Airport  because nobody was able to assist me through out the whole morning before I left for my excursions for the rest of the day.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Wonderful People,"I checked into Element MIA thinking I'd be here one short night, then fly out.  Well, my work down in Miami keeps getting extended, and eight days later, I'm still here.    I don't expect great service at airport hotels because most guests are just bunking for a night before taking off.  Hotels with less transient guests/with less rapid turnover are usually where service is top-notch.  Well, wonderful service resides at Element MIA as well!  The staff is made up of super nice, attentive, and genuinely warm folks.  Early on in my stay, Alejandro and Kandia at the front desk recognized how frazzled and stressed I was regarding work...so they sent up some treats and an inspiring ""keep at it"" note up to my room.  I was blown away.  When I thanked them they simply said they know how",Wow Mike! Thank YOU for sharing your impressions of your recent visit with us.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Incredible Hotel and Staff,"Right from the beginning this hotel didn't disappoint. We were picked up from the airport by an awesome driver in there shuttle. Emilio (the shuttle driver) was extremely cheerful and insightful even offering us cold water bottles as we entered the shuttle.  When we arrived at the hotel we were great by another cheerful employee Alejandro. Alejandro didn't only check us in but took the extra step to suggest different areas to visit and places to eat. Even with the phones ringing off the hook Alejandro made us feel as if we were the only ones staying at the hotel.   I had the opportunity to get acquainted ted with Vincent Walton. A chance meeting helped me realize why every employee is polite, smiling and willing to help. Vincent is the general manager. His pleasantness and","Thank you so much for your kind comments!

Element Miami International Airport,5,Unexpected stay needed up wonderful. ,"We unexpectedly had a plane delay and were given vouchers from American Airlines to stay at this property. We weren't expecting anything special due to the circumstances. We were pleasantly surprised! The hotel was absolutely wonderful. From the complimentary shuttle to the check in and check out, everything was great. We were greeted with friendly faces that evening. The rooms are spacious and equipped with everything you'd been for an extended stay. They have a restaurant that was nice also. We would definitely stay again if we were in the area!

Element Miami International Airport,4,Interesting stay,"It is not the hotel's fault, but when we arrived at 11:00 p.m., there was no electricity due to a power outage.  The hotel did its best to make us comfortable, but it did put a damper on our stay.  The staff was great, the bed was comfortable and the breakfast was adequate.  The carpet was pretty bad  and there was a slight off-putting odor (kind of musty), but not enough that I wouldn't stay there again.","Thank you so much for sharing your recent experience while you stayed here with us at the Element. It's unfortunate to hear about the power outage, that certainly must have been frustrating, however, I am pleased to know that our staff was able to ensure that you felt comfortable during your stay. We are going to renovate our property later this year and we invite you to pass by and have a look at the improvements that we will make.   We appreciate you for taking the time to write this review, we'd love to have you here next time your travels lead to Miami. "
Element Miami International Airport,1,Long Term Parking Good Luck!,"What a cluster! If you plan to park your car for a week GO ELSEWHERE. I half expected my car to not be there when we got back, thankfully it was. We got the last parking spot at the hotel when we arrived the night before our flight. I don't know where they would have put our car if that spot wasn't there.   I arranged to stay here PURPOSELY to have a place to keep my car parked for 7 days while on vacation. I PURPOSELY booked this DIRECTLY with the hotel so there would be no misunderstandings. They emailed me a confirmation of the booking which I had made over the phone 6 weeks in advance. I called the morning before we arrived to confirm they had our reservation including a record of our car being parked there for a week. They said yes. I called AGAIN that evening to say we","Customer service is the most important aspect of a hotel, so we will address all of your concerns with our team.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Disappointed!,"As an SPG member I've stayed a couple of times in this hotel when in Miami. This hotel has always been good on breakfast, cleanliness of rooms, shuttle transportation and other amenities. This last time however I was not happy at all with the service. To be honest I was stupefied by the way we were treated at the front desk. Normally I'm always greeted with a smile and an attitude of trying to accommodate the guest as best as possible. This time however we were not greeted when we came in, on various occasions when heading to the front desk for questions on shuttle times, luggage storage possibilities etc we were not being attended immediately, but instead looked at as if we were being a nuisance (instead of asking if they could help us).  I hope management can take note of this"," We recognize your time is valuable and appreciate the feedback you have provided on the Guest Satisfaction Survey.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Probably not again,"Checking in was fine after a long flight, get to the room with two teenagers, pull back my sheets, there is dried blood on one of my comforters on the bed .. pull out bowls from the kitchenette for popcorn, they were caked on dirty, call 3 times to get the sofa sleeper blankets .. everything in this hotel is slow .. even changing the damn channels on the TV.  Called SPG and they refunded my points but come on, dried blood and dirty bowls .. someone doesn't care about their job.  Probably not again unless we have to.  Sad.  One good thing is that the transportation to and from the hotel is 24/7 and they have a shuttle to take you to certain places and come back and pick you up, if you can get a hold of customer service.","Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconveniences that you experienced during your stay here at the Element.

What we found was was a lovely, clean hotel with super friendly staff. We weren't able to access our luggage so before heading out on a Walmart trip to get a few things we got a snack ( excellent hummus!) and a fantastic margarita in the restaurant.   After we returned from our shopping we went back for dinner. We had the pizza and wings, while not as amazing as the hummus, it was good. Staff seemed a little short handed but did a great job.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Easily accessible - great staff,"Stayed at this property for 5 nights during MMW and Ultra 2018 using starpoints. Staff were really great to deal with, and friendly. The location in relation to the airport is very handy, and in relation to Metro Dade County Transit system is amazing, you can be downtown almost as fast as with using Uber, especially during busy periods. The room itself isn't huge, but was a good fit for 3 adults. It included a full size fridge, cookware and dishes for an extended stay. The grocery store is about 6-8 minuet drive away (we used the bikes that the hotel provides, which I thought was really great for them to offer). The evening "" appetizers "" are slightly underwhelming, compared to other offerings from the competition.

Element Miami International Airport,4,"Comfortable and Good Value, When the Price is Right","I think I overpaid for this hotel (~$200) for one night. It was busy due to the Holy Week/Easter Holiday.  Staff was very friendly, breakfast was very basic but enough to get you going. The property is nice, but due to its location on the take off and landing path of a major runway, you will hear and feel planes until about 10 pm, and will start up again around 6 am.   Good place to spot planes and swim at the same time.   Food at bar/restaurant is convenient and taste good.   Good SPG Platinum recognition.","We appreciate the review of your recent stay at Element Miami International Airport ganzueto.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Excellent Value Hotel for Ultra,"If you're attending Ultra Music Festival and looking to spend a reasonable amount for lodging with excellent value, this would be a great option. I was able to fit 5 ppl into a room here for $200 each person for all 3 nights. This was far cheaper than the $500+ per night options in downtown Miami. Even with the Ubers to/from Ultra for all 3 days is still cheaper than staying downtown.  This hotel did not compromise on quality. The lobby was clean, modern-looking, and well-maintained. The staff was nice and accommodating to us too, trying to work with us for an early check-in. I did use the gym as well and felt it was just fine.  The unit that we stayed in was excellent. It was more of a studio than a traditional hotel room. It had a kitchen setup with a counter, stove, cabinets,","Thank you for your wonderful compliments of Element Miami International Airport.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Nice hotel with poor bus service,"We stayed one night (March 9th) before the cruise. While the hotel itself was very nice, relatively new, with modern decor, and quite sufficient breakfast, we were outraged with the shuttle service. We arrived at Miami International almost at midnight and tried to call the hotel a few times using different prompts provided in the automated message. For a long time either nobody picked up, or it went to voicemail. Eventually, after about half and hour, someone answered and promised to send the shuttle. However, it took another half an hour and a few attempts to call before the shuttle came. While we were waiting, we saw shuttles from other hotels multiple times, but there was nothing from Element. When it eventually arrived, the driver hardly said ""Hello"" and didn't bother to","Thank you for reaching out to us KansanKansan.

Raphaella is the best assets to SPG. I had the wonderful chance to meet one of the nicest ladies that I've had the pleasure of meeting.  As a matter of fact most of the staff was wonderful. I wish I could say the same for the front desk staff at the Element. There's a lot of customer service training that will need to done in the front desk department.

Breakfast was pretty varied and you could have various egg dishes cooked on the spot. Pool was largish and clean  with views over an adjacent lake.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Great at first glance...,"I travelled with my husband, 3 children and my parents.  We stayed on the top floor, with pool view.  At first everything looked very modern and new...but upon closer inspection, you could tell that the place wasn't as clean as it should be.  Fixtures in the bathroom were dirty and looked not cared for. Another clue was when I looked at my kids feet and they were BLACK within 30 minutes of being in the room (we live in the north...so they haven't been barefeet in months).  My husband grabbed a towel and cleaned a 5 x 5 square of the floating floor boards and the towel was black....ditto for the carpet.  And the couch also had some yucky stains on it.  There were dirty dishes in the dishwasher upon our arrival.  We asked for a complete scrub down of the room, which they did","Thank you for your feedback fauxhawk.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Decent airport hotel that somehow misses,"Assuming you are staying here because you need to be near airport (otherwise why would you stay under a noisy flight path and in a sketchy area?)...  Yes, it is loud. Windows do nothing to drown out planes, and other guests slammed doors constantly.   Rooms were stylish, but felt a bit cheap and floor was grossly sticky.   Employees ranged. Some were monosyllabic and unhelpful, others offered at least a smile.   Breakfast was fine. Limited buffet of eggs, cereals, toast, fruit and Chobani yogurt bar.   Awoken early by alarm telling us to evacuate immediately. Guests were milling about the lobby with absolutely no direction from staff for over 30 minutes. If this had been a real emergency, everyone would have perished.   Convenient shuttle service.  ","Thank you for your feedback Corey.

It is a very new, and modern hotel in an ""up and coming"" neighbourhood (to say it nicely).  It is gated, and I would not leave the premise at night without a vehicle.  There are many new building going up in the neighbourhood which should help ease some of the distress.  Our room was well appointed, and comfortable.  Breakfast was good as well (sausage, toast, eggs, cereal, coffee, tea, milk, juice); nothing exceptional, but it is included in the cost.

The complimentary beer and wine in the evenings is always nice, with very a pleasant hostess. The location is very close to the approach/takeoff for a busy airport, but not to much noise in the rooms. However you'll feel the noise when you're using the pool or relaxing outside. The close proximity to the train station with express bus to Miami Beach, and access to the train and metrorail. Uber is very handy for getting around as well.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Unimpressive,"This was probably my first time ever staying in a hotel that I strongly disagreed with the consensus Trip Advisor ratings.   We had just one night booked with my family at the Element the night before a very early flight out of Miami.  Firstly, arriving at the hotel, I found the outside looked more like an industrial building rather than a hotel. Not really a big deal I figured as the inside is the important part. Check in was fine. Person checking us was neither pleasant nor unpleasant but not unpleasant enough to warrant a slight against the hotel.  Once we got our keys we took our long walk to our room (it's a low rise but a very wide hotel).  Walking down the long hallways felt once again like I was walking in an industrial building.

Free breakfast has both hot and cold items and plenty of beverages. Room was adequate size for 2 people. I was really impressed with the shuttle service. First, the Mercedes van is very pretty and comfortable. The driver taking us from the airport not only unloaded the luggage but also brought it inside for us. The next morning I only was going to the car rental center so after the driver took the other passengers to the airport, he took me directly to where I needed to go. That saved me lots of time","Thanks for this glowing review. We appreciate your review of your recent stay at Element Miami International Airport.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Big and organized!,"This airport receives so many people in one day that it needs to be organized. If you are organized and get to know the airport before you get there, everthing will run smoothly.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Severe disappoinments in a hotel I'd learned to really enjoy,"I've stayed at this location numerous times, including solo bookings, as well as with other friends staying in multiple rooms (based on my recommendations). This was another solo booking prior to my cruise out of Port of Miami. I cruise 5+ times each year.    My first review of this property was a 5, using the word Perfection in the title (my only concern was that place they called a restaurant, but it didn't affect the primary hotel experience). Later visits were also enjoyable, though few were close to matching the level of that first one. That review received a lot of attention here on TA.  This last (and, most likely, final) stay was FAR from the expected level of service, cleanliness, and overall maintenance. Words to be used would included Disappointing, Dismal, and a bit","Thank you for reaching out to us.  We can understand your frustration if you found any areas, not at their best.

Element Miami International Airport,1,American Airlines strikes again,"So, flight 2 hours late and miss our connection due to a maintenance issue and get sent to the Element hotel.  Likely a minimum security jailhouse prior to its renovation.   Had to get late dinner at the salon "" restaurant "".  60 minutes if waiting for our bar food and we got a delicious combo of cold chicken wings and fries, and a pre-boxed salad.  The chips and pace picante sauce were the height of this epic meal.  Thanks American,  for sending us to such a great place!  (Sarcasm implied). One star as at least the front desk was efficient.  Oh wait!  My wife just got her burger.......cold, congealed, a taste adventure.  Best part is we waited so long for food that they started closing the restaurant and made us take our food to go.  Classy move! ","Thank you for your feedback.

Element Miami International Airport,4,"Great for a night, but not if you are looking for things to do","We booked a room at this hotel the night before our cruise. The room had two double beds, a large kitchen area (large fridge, cook top, microwave) and large bathroom. There is a free shuttle from the airport that runs every 30 min. However, there isn't a set pickup point, so if you don't flag it down you'll miss it (like we did).   The good - the room was clean, and staff was very friendly. Breakfast (which is free)in the morning was a mix of hot (eggs, French toast sticks, sausage) and cold (cereal, yogurt). There is a large fitness room with several weight and aerobic machines and free weights.   The bad - the hotel is not in a location with access to anything. There is construction and warehouse areas all around it, so don't plan to walk anywhere.   There is a free shuttle","Thank you very much for your wonderful review of the Element Miami International Airport!  We're thrilled that your stop-over has brought you to Miami and to us.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Rude staff,"The hotel in itself is quite ok. The room is spacious, the kitchen is well equipped, and the gym is great. But the staff is really rude (not all of them of course). The housekeeping and the shuttle drivers are very nice and polite, but the front desk staff is simply rude. They were talking about me in Spanish, thinking that I won't understand. I had a problem and I asked them for some help, and they couldn't be more unhelpful. One of the staff members was very condescending.  The evening reception is a great touch. I didn't have the chance to have breakfast, but from what I saw, it looked delicious. The bar/restaurant was good, but again, the staff made the experience bad. The bartender seemed to be bothered by the clients.  The hotel could be much better if they trained their","Customer service is the most important aspect of our hotel, so we will address all of your concerns with our team.

Element Miami International Airport,4,"Good property but RIGHT under the flight path, so take ear plugs!","Good handy location with simple terminal pick up, but the place is an aircraft spotters dream as the fly low and slow over the hotel. You can read the fuselage!!! Thus our sleep was average as the first flights take off early, but the food we had in the bar was tasty and the general ambiance was delivered well.","Thank you for your input David. We are indeed an airport hotel, and as you perfectly coined ""aircraft spotter dream"".

Element Miami International Airport,4,Comfy Stays,"We got the 3rd floor room. Really like the room since we just came back from airbnb in the Bahamas. They offer free drinks at 4PM - 7 PM when we were there, and break feast in the morning at lobby also. Do note that there is no restaurant near by so you might need to take an uber or lyft to grab a bit to eat unless you want deliver. Also no walking distant of 7/11, Walmart, CVS etc. However you are really close to the train station, which you can take direct to the beach or DT. Good price for the stay, and shuttle every hour.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Hotel stay was comfortable,Unplanned stay in Miami.  Our plane got in late so we missed our connecting flight.  American Airlines gave us a voucher to stay here.   The room was spacious.  The bed very comfortable.  I sometimes could hear planes taking off from my room.  My friend I was traveling with was in another room so he couldn't hear the planes from his room.  The restaurant/bar served cafe' type of food and it was delicious.,"Missing a connecting flight could be exceedingly frustrating.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Over and Beyond Amazing service!,"Firstly, Thank you to the New GM! (More on that in a few)  The staff is really, Really Friendly! They treat you like house guests! They'll chat, but not too much. They'll make sure you're comfy, but don't hover. And the GM is present, in the Lobby (Very Accessible and observing everything) during Breakfast.   We had the largest room available (so our 1 ½ year old would have room to roam).  It was a great stay!  I'm a stickler for clean floors, and I have NO Complaints! We had toys everywhere! And I wasn't bugging out about the cleanliness of the room.   The kitchens are really full-size. And actually have all of the pots, pans, plates & flatware needed for 4.

Element Miami International Airport,5,"Convenient, clean, comfortable","The bed was the best so comfortable and sheets were so soft. Too bad its proximity to the airport means you hear flights taking off and trains honking their horns in the morning. I liked the happy hour free cheese and crackers and free wine and beer. They were very generous with their beer, so thanks! The free breakfast was also a good add-on and they had a variety of hot and cold foods. Only negative I have to say is that they charge $18/night for parking there (ouch!).","Thank you for your wonderful compliments of Element Miami International Airport.

Element Miami International Airport,3,"New and modern, extra charge for parking","Hotel looks new and very modern.  Very nice room.  Don't be fooled by the cheap rate.  They will hit you for $18 per night for parking!  Picked this hotel because they have an electric car charger.  But it turns out they only have one and the charge rate is so slow my car will not be nearly fully charged by the morning.  I feel like they misrepresented the price and the charger and I will not be back.  BTW, their website does not allow reviews.  I guess this is the new way companies are dealing with unhappy customers.","Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We regret you were not made aware of our parking charge prior to your arrival. Our parking rate is noted on our hotel website. It is not our intention to 'fool' our valuable guests.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Great business hotel,"Element Miami airport is a great business/pleasure hotel for the price.

Exercise room and pool are available.    Downsides would be it's in an industrial part of town.  Wont be walking outside the compound.  Also, if you dont like to eat at the hotel, you have to drive out to some place or order take out.  Also, airplanes flying overhead through the day and night.

Rooms are ok  but I saw a little worn out doors and disrepairs, still not bad, is a good hotel but not outstanding compared to its other sister properties. The rooms come with a safe, frigobar, free wifi and a  small kitchenette, I would not cook there at all. Happy hour offered Mondays trough Fridays  is free but the  quality is not great at all, (yes I know is feee but at the Element DFW  the same happy hour concept was also free and outstanding) mind as  well skip it for the very nice pool and beware that for reasons that still can't  understand  parking does not come for free, at $20.00 dollars per day is a complete ripoff, with this being said your ","Thank you for taking the time to reach out and let us know about your recent experience, as your feedback is invaluable to us.

Arrived from U.K. Took a bit of time from leaving the airport to finding the shuttle despite emailing flight etc we were on and getting no reply. Got the shuttle (black bus) and check in was swift. Endless supply of fresh water tea and coffee in reception and this was a bright and airy environment. We were allocated 526 view towards down town Miami and a garage close by.  The room was perfect, good size of bathroom. Very comfy bed. Well stocked kitchen area. Breakfast was plentiful. Basic but cereal fruit, hot items, selection of juices and bread bagels etc. The location is pretty remote so be prepared to eat in. Food ok pizza and wings $40 including tip. Was looking forwArd to a beer but was informed NO","We couldn't help but smile while reading your review. It is wonderful to hear that you were so impressed with your room and all the amenities that we offer! Our new management company is working diligently obtaining our alcohol license. We look forward to welcoming you back the next time you are in Miami.  Regards,   Juan Rivera Director of Sales Juan.Rivera@ElementMiamiAirport.com"
Element Miami International Airport,3,Accounting Customer Service,"The company I work for had a guest stay at this property in September. The guest was charged for charges we were covering, so I called to get the charges corrected. We sent email requests and left voicemail's for accounting multiple times and I have yet to receive a phone call from accounting. Unfortunately, it took about 4 weeks to speak to someone about the issue and hopefully it gets done ASAP.","Thank you for sharing your comments with us.

Element Miami International Airport,3,"Good gym, close to airport. Wifi needs improvement","I recently stayed here for a quick business trip. The hotel is easy to get too. The rooms are nice, but the wifi was very poor and the cable kept going out. The best part of the hotel is the gym.  Clean, spacious and newer equipment.  ","Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your recent stay at Element Miami Airport. While we were pleased to learn that you enjoyed our rooms and gym, we cannot help but feel disappointed that you felt some aspects of your stay were lacking.

Element Miami International Airport,2,Starwood this is not your finest,Single night stay. I have been a loyal Starwood guest for many years. This is NOT your finest property.   The room was as I would expect - clean  However the restaurant was awful. I was told all sandwiches are precooked - so I had to have a burger that was well done. The patty itself was nothing more than a Sam's club frozen disk.  It was certainly not a beef steak burger as advertised. I asked about soup and grilled cheese with a side of fries and was told I would have to pay an extra $7 for a side of fries!!!!!  To top it off the bar was not able to serve alcohol. This is something that I should have been told at check in. Had I know the above I would have made alternative arrangements for dining.   I hope that my breakfast experience is better. As so far this has been,"Thank you for sharing your insight.

Element Miami International Airport,5,A good option; slightly isolated location ,"The hotel works well - rooms are comfortable and well appointed.  Simple yet effective.  Beds are comfortable, internet is fast and effective. Public areas are open and the restaurant works well with simple, healthy options. Service was great all around. Location is very close to the airport, but slightly isolated with nothing within walking distance. ","We appreciate your review of your recent stay at Element Miami International Airport.  I am happy you enjoyed our hotel amenities and had an excellent visit overall.  We look forward to welcoming you back the next time you are in Miami.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Imagine my surprise to find myself unexpectedly spending the night in miami,"However finding the Element was a nice surprise.  as you can tell a few hundred of us coming from Europe had a missed connection resulting in a night in Miami.  the staff was quite lovely getting us to the hotel, settled, fed and the next morning carting us off to the airport at 0400.","Thank you for your review of your recent stay here.

We look ahead to your next stay with us here at Element Miami International Airport.  Regards,  Juan Rivera Director of Sales Juan.Rivera@ElementMiamiAirport.com"
Element Miami International Airport,4,A  fabulous place for everyone,"While getting to hotel I was bit skeptical. The round and the surrounding is not the best in Miami. The building itself doesn't really stand out from the outside. Also, when I learned about the parking cost $17 per day, I wasn't thrilled. However, that is Miami and I know its similar or more in other hotels. Luckily there was plenty of street parking for free which I felt comfortable parking at. Now the best part was the room, the amenities in the room and the view. It is basically a furnished studio with all the stuff you need. I mean I have stayed in several 4 star hotels before but actually have a counter top stove, big freeze, microwave and pots and pans? Everything is extremely clean and classy. The receptionist were very plesent. It also included free breakfast which was","Thank you for your detailed description of our hotel!

Element Miami International Airport,5,Vacation after our vacation ,We stayed at this hotel 2 days after our family cruise It was kid friendly The pool was nice The hotel staff very friendly We loved it because it was affordable close to downtown Miami And not too much of an Uber ride to south beach  Our kids had a nice time and so did we,"Providing our guests with terrific amenities, comfort and service to ensure all their travels needs are met are important to us and we are thrilled that you appreciated this.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Hotel charged me twice for a single night and refuses to refund the double charge,"Hotel charged me twice for a single night and is refusing to refund me the extra charge. Stayed in the hotel for a single night. Had my flight to Miami delayed, and called hotel to inform I would arrive after midnight. After a 5 hours flight delay, was able to arrive at hotel around 3-4am. When arrived, reception employee informed me there it was marked as a no show. I mentioned I had called informing I would arrive after midnight, she checked, and confirmed indeed the reservation had that tag. To resolve, she created a new reservation and checked me in. After I came back from my trip, I noticed the hotel had charged me again for the second reservation. After numerous complaints, hotel has still not refunded me, claiming I didn't call, when I proved I called then they stated","Thank you for sharing your feedback regarding your visit with us, Andrew.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Never got there!,Tried to cancel due to hurricane Irma. Couldn't get through to let them know due to mandatory evacuation from S Beach and no communications. Sorry for letting them down. Exceptional circumstances. Got billed of course. ,"Thank you, Terry, for sharing your experience with us.  We understand the circumstances that arose from Hurricane Irma, and would be happy to speak with you regarding your bill.  Please contact us so that we may be of help.  Thank you! "
Element Miami International Airport,2,It may say Westin on the sign ..this is not Westin,"I have spent nights in a few Westin's around the US. What comes to mind when I think of the Westin Brand is a higher quality hotel and great service. I found none of these at the Element. The check-in person was obnoxious. The woman behind the bar had no people skills. My food got cold waiting for her to figure out how to take orders and deliver them to the tables. When there were two people helping her, who didn't understand customer service. The carpets on the way to my room were soiled with stains, they were filthy. The only positive was the layout of the room included a kitchenette.","Thank you for sharing your insight.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Sent by American Airlines,"Quickest check-in EVER! Great, modern studio room. Near the airport with a regular shuttle. Yummy body wash, lotion etc. I really enjoyed my hot night and morning showers!!!!  The only drawback is that I could hear the plumbing in neighbouring room(s). And footsteps outside my door seemed more audible than they usually are.   Notwithstanding, I had a restful night and was off bright and early next morning.","Whether you are visiting Element Miami International Airport for business or pleasure, we are an ideal fit for anyone visiting the area.  We have a variety of amenities to please all of our guests and our location next to the airport and just minutes from downtown, make it easy to catch a flight or enjoy the area.

Element Miami International Airport,1,Beware of the parking charge!,So I thought I got a great hotel deal on priceline.  But they don't tell you that you have to pay a $16 parking fee PER DAY!  Sucks when you think you are getting a great deal and it ends up that you could have gotten a nicer hotel with the money you spent on parking!  Grrrrrr!  NOT A GOOD DEAL!,"Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We regret you were not made aware of our parking charge prior to your arrival. When booking through a third party, it is important to fully review the hotel you have chosen. Our parking rates are noted on our website. We hope to have the chance to welcome you back so we may win you over completely.  "
Element Miami International Airport,1,Worst hotel quality ever,"The staff was very nice but the accommodations were horrible!  I don't normally write bad reviews but people need to know. The first room for $111 was a pull out sofa in a room that was never cleaned and a door at the foot of the ""bed"" though which I could hear loud snoring. I got another room and it was so noisy for so long that I had to call the front desk. Eventually it stopped but I only got 3 hours sleep :(  this room wasn't much cleaner. The pillows were so grossly stained. The thin pillow case didn't hide it well. There was peanuts and other dirt on the floor. I think if it looks clean, they don't do anything.","We're truly saddened to learn that our hotel fell short of your expectations. The feedback we receive from our guests is always appreciated and so important to us, so we will be sure to go over your comments with our maintenance and housekeeping departments. We are, however, happy to hear that our staff impressed and hope you will consider giving us another chance one day."
Element Miami International Airport,5,very comfortable studio rooms in a nice place near a lake,"Hotel close to the aiport. The rooms are amazing, with a kitchen and sofa. all the amenities that you need in the room. The hotel also has a very nice lobby and piscina where you can relax. The only cons is not very close to the city centre.","What a fantastic review!

Element Miami International Airport,4,Stay here!,"This hotel was a welcome surprise! Beautiful inside setting. I had a large room with a full size refrigerator, cook top stove, dishes, and full size sofa. The shuttle service was great with about a 5 minute ride from MIA in a Mercedes shuttle. The pool is big and even has a wheelchair lift which I was very impressed to see. I highly recommend this hotel!","Wow, what a glowing review and high recommendation for other travelers! It is flattering to read that you enjoyed the beauty of our hotel as well as our amenities. Your compliments mean a lot to us, and we hope to welcome you back to Element Miami International Airport for another wonderful stay.   "
Element Miami International Airport,4,Classy design and comfort ,"I found this hotel to have a sleek and modern interior design with comfortable room. The Element is environmentally friendly hotel with many of its amenities fitted to address energy conservation. You can even park your fuel efficient vehicle in pre-assigned space.   The standard room is moderate in size equipped with fully functional kitchenette. The bathroom has enclosed shower and properly furnished. And adequate lighting.  The hotel offers a small ""Salon""restaurant and bar with manageable menu for adults and kids alike.  The reception staff are very friendly and cordial. However the lobby is very noisy not from the guests but from some janitorial staff chatting.   Great place to be. ","We are delighted that you enjoyed so much of the complimentary services we offer, such as the cuisine at The Salon at Element, an evening reception of food and drinks, parking, and of course the convenient shuttle service.  At our Miami eco-friendly hotel, you'll find sustainable services and practices that make it easy to play a role in being environmentally friendly.  We are thrilled that you appreciated our eco-friendly hotel.  We look forward to your next stay at Element Miami International Airport! "
Element Miami International Airport,5,Weird location but great hotel!,We enjoyed a week at this hotel.  It is near the airport and you can occasionally hear planes fly over (we were on the 4th floor).  Parking seemed to be an issue.  When we would leave in the morning employees seemed to be competing to get our parking place (one actually stood in our space one morning after we pulled out until her co-worker could come and get the spot).   The breakfast was satisfactory.  The wraps are definitely better than the English muffin sandwiches.,Thank you for your generous praise of The Element Miami International Airport.  It is our intention to accommodate our guest's needs at every turn while providing a friendly and relaxed atmosphere.  We are so pleased that your expectations of both the hotel and its staff were exceeded at the time of your stay with us.  It would be our pleasure to welcome you back if you find your way back to Miami. 
Element Miami International Airport,3,Poor service at Element,"I was booked in here due to a delayed American Airlines flight. The location isn't the greatest but fine for an overnight stay. The rooms are functional with a kitchen in the room. The low level lighting and colours made the room look very miserable to me. Others may have a different view.   The bathroom has the most basic of essentials, bar of soap and wall mounted shampoo/body wash dispensers. Very green but also a bit budget looking in my view. The bed though was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep.   Where the hotel let itself down for me was the service. When I checked in I handed in my SPG Gold card to ask if it could be added to my stay. The agent totally dismissed me and said it wasn't possible because it wasn't my booking. I only wanted it added for",Thank you for your feedback. We would like to extend our heartfelt apologies for your disappointing experience with us.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Convenient to MIA,"This hotel is very close to MIA airport, just a couple blocks away. However it is in a very dark neighborhood. The hotel property is surrounded by an 8 foot spikes fence for security. We checked in with Nancy late at night for our brief 6 hour stay. In the middle of checking in she answered the phone and just walked away from us for a period of time. After checking in my daughter returned to Nancy to request additional blankets. Nancy said they would be delivered to our room. They never showed up. There is an airport shuttle that runs every 30 minutes around the clock. The room was very comfortable - love the beds and comforters. We had a very quiet couple of hours of sleep before leaving for an early flight. Rooms have a stove and fridge. ","Thank you for choosing our hotel and for taking the time to reach out and share your experience. Please know that the safety, comfort and satisfaction of our guests are always our highest priority. The issues that you encountered will be discussed to reinforce efforts in providing the level of service our guest expect from us. We're glad that you enjoyed such a peaceful night's rest before your early flight. We hope to see you again. "
Element Miami International Airport,4,"Nice hotel, awfull area",Hated the fact I had to pay $18 for parking a day and that wasn't mentioned when I made the reservation. We requested an extra towel which we received the next day after complaining 3 times. Breakfast is good and social hour was great. The hotel area is not a place you can leave your car outside of the property or walk around. The property itself is very nice and the rooms are spacious. I would recommend a friends but hotel does need improvements.,"Thank you for taking the time to provide details regarding your most recent experience at our hotel.  We are glad you were able to enjoy comfortable accommodations as well as a delicious breakfast at our very own, The Salon at Element.

We look forward to your next stay with us at Element Miami International Airport. "
Element Miami International Airport,3,Nice clean and all you need for one day,"The last night in Miami, we want to stay near the AirPort and we did. This is a stay for one day, there is no place to go out, but you can order pizza.. and they deliver at the front desk. You have all you need at the room to make some food. (you just need to find a food marked) If I go back, it will be for one nigth again, before the cruice or the next trip..etc. ",We are delighted you found our hotel to be a great place to stay! It was certainly a pleasure to accommodate you for the night and we're glad that our convenient location to the airport worked out so well for you. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Element Miami International Airport. 
Element Miami International Airport,3,Pre-cruise hotel ,"My family and I stayed at the hotel a day prior to our cruise departure.   Pros:  We did utilize the complimentary hotel shuttle. I believe they explained that they run every thirty minutes. The hotel decor, and lobby was nicely decorated. The exercise room was probably slightly better than most hotels. We also used the laundry room and the had several washers and dryers ( I believe 5 of each).  Our children loved swimming in the pool and made lots of new friends. The room was a standard suite with a door to separate from the kids- which is nice when you want peace and quiet. Each room has dishes, pots and pans a large fridge and a range.  Cons: As I mentioned above, we had a separate room from our children. The couch was a pullout sofa bed. However the room did not have linens.","Thank you for sharing details of your experience with us.  We are happy to know you enjoyed your guest room as well as our public spaces and complimentary shuttle service.  When our guests share any concern, we take them very seriously and want you to know that our team has been notified of your feedback.  Hospitality and service are cornerstones of our business and you should never expect anything less.  We hope you will reconsider another stay for your next trip to Miami.   "
Element Miami International Airport,5,Modern and clean hotel near airport,"Although this hotel does not have room service, this is one of the best hotels I've stayed near an airport. Very friendly staff, free breakfast (which includes hot breakfast, not just continental). Also, there is a ""social hour"" in the early evening with appetizers which I find pretty neat.  24 hour free coffee. The room I stayed in (studio one king bed) was very specious, clean and convenient with the kitchenette. Convenient for being 5 minutes from the airport and with free shuttle. Perfect for a business trip or if you want to be close to downtown (10 min Uber) or South Beach (15 min Uber) which is what I did. It was very affordable as opposed to staying in downtown.","We'd first like to mention how truly honored we are that you chose to spend your time in Miami at Element Miami International Airport. We truly can't thank you enough for sharing your experience regarding the customer service that you received.  Our hotel is in a great location being close to the airport, and our guests really love our complimentary shuttle service and fresh cuisine options at our on-site restaurant, The Salon at Element!

Element Miami International Airport,5,Great hotel with FoxNews in the lobby,What a great find in Miami we came here for the All-Star game at Marlins Park and stayed here at The Element hotel the rooms are beautiful the breakfast is nice the front lobby area is very modern but unfortunately being near train tracks and the airport a lot of noise at 6:50 in the morning that originally had my rating at a 3 but I pushed it to a 5 because the front desk had the balls to switch the lobby television from fake news CNN to Fox News.

Our staff is dedicated to providing thoughtful service for all of our guests and your account precisely describes who we strive to be for our guests.  We'd love to welcome you back very soon and we thank you again for your review. 
Element Miami International Airport,2,Precruise Stay,"This hotel has great possibilities, but something is missing. We stayed at this location twice, two days before our cruise and one day afterwards. Our room before the cruise wasn't as bad as the second room. The kitchen area was clean, and there were no stains on the couch or bed. Unfortunately, the toilet seat (which was up when my wife went into the bathroom the first time) was filthy. I discovered the mess when I was preparing to get in the shower and closed the seat to place the towel on it. The seat was disgusting. Fortunately the maid came in while the wife was in our daughters room down the hall. I was able to make sure the seat top was cleaned.   The carpet in both rooms was the same color, a dark muddy brown. The carpet color hides the dirt, I think house keeping","Thank you for sharing your comments with us.  While we were pleased to learn that you enjoyed a positive rapport with our staff, we cannot help but feel disappointed that you felt some aspects of your stay were lacking.

Thank you for your recommendation and compliments and we look forward to greeting you again soon. "
Element Miami International Airport,1,"Extremely dated, awful service, unclean rooms","I am astonished at the positive reviews for this hotel. I travel quite a lot and this was one of the worse hotel experiences I have had. First, when I landed in Miami, I called the hotel to ask where to find a shuttle. After being on hold for over 10 minutes, a person got on the line and brusquely said ""five minutes"" when I asked when and where I would find the shuttle. When I asked WHERE I should get the shuttle (no clear signage at the airport), he said something brief in Spanish and hung up. My partner called back and after another 10-minute hold was told to wait anywhere and flag down the shuttle.  When we got to the hotel, there is a tiny reservation desk with two people manning it. Across from the check in, a man was waiting to buy a beer and charge it to his room (the","We thank you for sharing your perspective.  Feedback like yours helps us to better understand the needs of our guests and we will have our team look into your comments regarding your accommodations.  We do regret any inconvenience you may have experienced with your guest suite.  Our hotel follows an eco-friendly policy, so for those guests staying with us for five or more nights, our housekeeping team tidies the room once every three days in an effort to decrease the amount of water, energy, and resources we use. Once a week, bed linens are changed and the room is deep cleaned unless additional changes are requested. Our team continually refreshes our commitment to our guests and we are always available.  It is our hope to welcome you back so we may restore your confidence in us and provide you with the type of experience you anticipated.   "
Element Miami International Airport,4,Stay was okay,"Hotel visit was okay rooms were great, breakfast was okay but not so great.

Everything we do is aimed at providing you with an excellent hotel experience. We appreciate your feedback, and we hope to welcome you back to Element Miami International Airport again in the future. "
Element Miami International Airport,4,Good value ,"Nice room, the shower and bed are great, with kitchen and sofa bed (poor mattress on the sofa bed). The rooms are very quiet, surprisingly so, considering the distance to the airport. Good grab-and-go breakfast options, but not much for those on a gluten-free diet. Parking is expensive, and inconsiderate guests allow their children the run of the public areas, including the exercise room, and management does nothing. The rooms are well laid out, but are showing age. The TV took 7 minutes to warm up, and wooden fixtures' veneer is peeling. The bathroom floor was never clean, and with no fan or working ac in the bathroom, the paint is bubbling and peeling. We had several issues with keys. I would probably stay again, but with adjusted expectations.","From start to finish, we hope all of our guests feel just the same when they stay with us.  Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback and appreciation for the Element Miami International Airport.  We are honored to know that you found our accommodations to be the best comfort in the hotel industry.

We appreciate your feedback, and will share this with our team.  We look forward to your next stay with us in the future! "
Element Miami International Airport,4,perfect for air travel,"First, we booked a room that came with 7 days of parking included. Saved us a BUNCH of money on parking at the airport. The hotel shuttle ran promptly every 30 minutes to the airport. Very friendly. Super clean. Good bfast buffet in the morning - very crowded, though. The full kitchen would have been nice had we been at the hotel longer.","We love that you were so well impressed with our associates' service here at Element Miami International Airport.

Element Miami International Airport,1,"Terrible Customer Service, Fraudulent Charge","We booked this hotel in June for a trip in October.  We were planning to spend the night  in Miami prior to a cruise.  Loved all the amenities this hotel offered.  Unfortunately, we will NEVER stay here.  We reserved the hotel, choosing to pay upon arrival.  The charge went through on our card in June.  We have called them repeatedly, left messages, asked for our money back.  We've since cancelled the reservation and still NO returned calls, NO communication from the hotel, NO refund.  We will not be using this hotel.  We've had to file a dispute with our bank and I'm very disappointed that this hotel has done nothing to respond, nothing to resolve, and I'm having to wait nearly a month to get money back that shouldn't have been charged to begin with.",Your experience is not consistent with our reservation procedures or the level of service we pride ourselves on. I am truly sorry if we somehow fell short. Your feedback is important and we regret that this was not evident from the start.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Near the Port,"We always stay here when are going on a cruise out of Miami. It has a shuttle and you get to the ship relaxed from a great nights sleep the previous night and a good breakfast, which is complementary. The bar is also very nice and open.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Excellent Stop-over Hotel,"The Element Miami International Airport is an excellent, Starwood-branded hotel for travelers who are transiting through the Miami International Airport and have a lay-over.  But be warned, it's not a destination hotel and is located behind security fencing in an industrial neighborhood near the airport.  Do not choose this hotel as your base for a multi-night, Miami-based vacation.    In our case, we arrived one evening and were scheduled 22 hours later to fly on to Barcelona.  We used Uber to take us to Miami Beach for a few hours the following morning. In this regard, the late-check-out offered by the Element was much appreciated.  The hotel itself is very clean and offers both complimentary breakfast plus a limited-menu restaurant for dinner.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed for a couple of nights before we headed home after 2 weeks in Florida.  The hotel is lovely, the rooms spacious with everything that you could possibly need with lovely bathrooms. The continental breakfast was good and a complimentary snack late afternoon was very welcoming.  The shuttle bus is an excellent idea, we were taken to the supermarket nearby and picked up again, the drivers were very pleasant and helpful.  We spent our last day by the pool, the hotel stored our cases and we could use the outside enclosed showers to freshen up. However the hotel does charge for parking. If you don't mind the aircraft flying over every few seconds this is an ideal place to stay before your onward journey.  Would certainly recommend and would stay again.","Sandra, we can't thank you enough for sharing such a glowing review and for your gracious praise for our hotel.  Everyone at Element Miami International Airport takes great pride in caring for our guests and doing whatever we can to create an exceptional experience.  We are thrilled you could appreciate our complimentary shuttle service, evening reception of food and drinks, as well as the cuisine at our very own, The Salon at Element.  We are truly grateful for your recommendation and we're looking forward to welcoming you back on your next visit to Miami! "
Element Miami International Airport,3,Cancelled Flight ,"My husband and I were put up in the element by our airline as our flight was cancelled. We were picked up just outside the airport by the courtesy shuttle. The driver offered us a cold bottle of water once on board which was really nice. We arrived at the hotel in the dark so can't say to much other than we noticed it's a gated property. The reception area was very clean and modern looking, We were given a room straight away-none of our details were taken I'm guessing this is because the airline booked the room. The lady at reception explained that the restaurant was still open and we could use out food/drink voucher there and breakfast was between 7-10am. We had a room on the 4th floor, the room was beautiful, really well laid out, spacious, clean and really well equipped. I","It was our pleasure to assist you with your booking and to provide you with fantastic service!

Element Miami International Airport,4,Great choice near the airport.,"Free airport shuttle runs every 30 min but make sure you enter a ""black van"" - there are two Elements in the area. The hotel has nice layout and open design and we enjoyed our surprisingly large room . It included convenient kitchenette and rest area. Microwave, fridge, utensils and cooking range allowed us to save money and enjoy our night meal in the room. In the lobby they offer assortment of frozen meals - so practical. We did not use the pool or gym but we did enjoy the simple breakfast included in price. Coffee, tea, juices, burritos, breads and bagels, yogurt and fruit; you could argue it was no gourmet meal but certainly a sufficient nourishing breakfast before you go. The bed was comfortable, wifi free, nice charging station. The floor in the room was dirty, probably","It was our pleasure to welcome you to our hotel and to provide you with attentive service at every turn!   We are thrilled you had the chance to enjoy dining with us at The Salon at Element and were able to utilize the full-service Kitchenette in your guest suite.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Great place to stay ...but pass on the free breakfast ,"I have stayed at numerous hotels that offer a free breakfast but this one should give you a credit if you are brave enough to eat cold stale pancakes, bad oatmeal, & beware of the cardboard ""egg sandwich"" Come on Westin make sure the coffee is fresh is that asking too much, we had to go back to the room and make coffee.  Now that I have that out of the way, great location, free shuttle even with a 1am arrival.  Nice room with a heavenly shower.  We would stay again,  just plan on eating out for breakfast.","Thank you so much for your review, Dan! We are delighted that your stay with us was a great one.

Element Miami International Airport,4,"Clean, Modern, Comfortable","My wife and I stayed at the Element in mid April, 2017 for 1 night before our Cruise.  The location is approximately a 5 to 7 minute drive from the airport.  The rooms are large, we had a kitchenette suite.  The rooms are quiet, well appointed, clean and modern.  Breakfast is included and airport / cruise ship shuttles are available.  Our 1 night stay was was quite nice and we definitely recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the Miami airport area.","It was a pleasure to welcome you and your wife to the Element Miami International Airport, Richard!

Element Miami International Airport,4,Good value,"Having arrived into Miami airport from Europe decided to stay overnight before driving on the next morning. Shuttle from the airport to the hotel.  You just stand outside of arrivals and watch for your respective hotel mini bus and flag them down.  Returning to the airport you can get the shuttle from the hotel.  We were going to the car rental in the morning and the bus driver dropped off people at the airport then took us to the car rental. Searching on the web this seemed to fit the bill, not far from airport or from car rental which meant easy to pick up car the next morning. Easy and prompt check in. Spacious room with limited kitchen with microwave. Seating area. Extremely comfortable bed. Bed linen spotless.  Bathroom good size with double shower.  Slight leak from the","Thank you for taking the time to share the highlights of your visit. It is always wonderful to hear when a guest enjoys so much of their stay with us.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Good Airport Hotel,"We stayed here when we missed a flight connection.  The hotel is very conveniently located near the airport, and provides a shuttle service.  The hotel features a modern design, including in the room.  The rooms are relatively large, and well-appointed.  There are few restaurants nearby, but the hotel has a decent little restaurant, and features a happy hour with snacks.  Breakfast was good.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.","Thank you for your glowing review!  How wonderful that you choose Element Miami International Airport.

Element Miami International Airport,3,"Good Hotel, Strange Location","We were upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise. A great size for families but I'm unsure whether there was a pullout sofa. The kitchen and bathroom is large and clean. The pool is salt water and really comfortable. Everything within the hotel was great, service was fine. The location is a little out of the way but very close to the airport. A great hotel for people traveling through Miami or if you've already seen Miami. If you really want to experience Miami, I would choose somewhere else.","We appreciate you sharing your experience with us, Wendy!  A visit to our hotel sounds like a perfect, relaxing getaway and we are truly grateful to know you enjoyed your time with us, and what a treat to be placed in an upgraded suite!  From friendly service to comfortable accommodations, we couldn't be happier that you loved your stay.

Element Miami International Airport,3,Airport convenience and friendly staff,"Let's start with the positives:- We had a stop in Miami before and after our cruise and this was perfect for airport location.  We had a suite which included a living space with fold out sofa, kitchen and bedroom which was pefect for our needs.  We enjoyed the friendly staff and the free breakfast which was very popular. They had a laundry for guest use (just buy your own detergent as it gets a little expensive) and a great gym and pool.  The items you cannot control:- 1.  Location.  Although it is a great location for the airport that is just about it.  If you want meals you need to drive out a few miles.  Full disclosure, the shuttle staff are AMAZING! We needed diapers and they took my husband to a Walgreens a mile away and the front dest staff were able to give us a few","We appreciate you sharing your detailed experience with us here at Element Miami International Airport.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Enjoyed the Stay but in the Middle of NO WHERE,"I was using this hotel the night before a cruise. The airport pick up was fine, in the time they said it would be. The hotel is not far from the airport. Check in went smoothly with a nice staff. I went to the room and when I walked in the door I was hit with a very strong mildew smell. I called the desk and asked for another room. They promptly sent someone up with a key to a new room, and a can of deodorizer to spray in the mildew room. The next check in got the mildew room with spray.The rooms were very nice and very clean. I was very pleased.  They had a cocktail and snack hour which was very nice. Good food and that is good because of the location. Nice terrace to eat and drink on. The hotel had a small restaurant but it was very expensive.  Breakfast the next day was OK. I","It is always a pleasure to hear from our guests at the Element Miami International Airport.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Great hotel in the weirdest place.,"We stayed here three nights. Comfy beds, quiet eventhough jets are blasting out of Miami Intl. close- by. This new hitel is truly built in a way that is very sound proof. I saw lots of transiting pilots sleep here. That is a sign. The only down side would be thise darn jets taking off non stop. Annoying when you are trying to hold a conversation at the pool.","Thank you for sharing your perspective with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed a 3-night stay with us.  Our guest suites are complete with @Heavenly beds to ensure the highest level of comfort for a restful night's sleep.

Element Miami International Airport,5,Was perfect for what I needed,"I decided to stay at a hotel the airport since I was getting into Miami at night, and did not want to rent a car, and drive into the city that late.  I went on Priceline and found this hotel, which I had never heard of before (because you never know the name of the hotel on Priceline until you have paid).  I had no idea what to expect.  How surprised was I to find that the shuttle was so efficient and the hotel was perfect.  Full kitchen, king bed, and a pull out sofa.  The staff was very nice, there was free breakfast (loved that there were smoothies), and the shuttle dropped me at the rental car place the next morning.  I was so pleased that I stayed there again, the night before my very early flight back to California.  It is a Westin hotel. I recommend it highly.","Thank you for sharing your experience at the Element Miami International Airport with us! We're always happy to do what we can to make your experience a great one, and we're glad that you were pleasantly surprised with how perfect our hotel was, complete with a full-service kitchenette in your guest suite, and the taste of a delicious homemade smoothie at our on-site restaurant.

Element Miami International Airport,4,Nice stay,"The room are spacious, clean and not too noisy even if close to the airport. Breakfast could be improved with some additional attendant, because after 8:30 am in the weekend there were so many customers that the attendant could not keep the pace thus ending up with some empty food containers. Pool was great for kids in the afternoon. Parking is big too and easy access.","It was a joy to have you with us at the Element Miami International Airport!

Element Miami International Airport,5,Fantastic Airport Hotel!,"We got trapped in Miami on our way home from Costa Rica and ended up at the Element for 2 nights.  I would not vacation here, but I give them high marks for an airport hotel.  Good, friendly service.  Rooms with kitchens. Nice pool.  Gym!  Laundry facilities.  The restaurant that is only open in the evenings was good.  Easy to take Lyft wherever you may want to go.  Airport shuttle, of course. Small market.  Would have liked to seen a better selection of food. Breakfast was ok, not great.  It feeds the masses, nothing special. Can't go wrong here if you need an airport hotel.","We are elated with your review of your recent experience here at Element Miami International Airport!

Element Miami International Airport,4,Great Experience Except...,"Overall, this is a great hotel. The staff is friendly, though some barely spoke or didn't speak English. The hotel is generally clean and full of first rate amenities. My family (wife & two young kids) loved the heated salt water pool. The planes flying overhead, while it may bother some, was very stimulating for my two boys. I didn't use it, but the fitness center looked modern and clean as well. The studio-suites a kitchenette with two electric burners, sink, microwave, refrigerator, and dishwasher. We also had two double-beds and a sofa, which made the whole suite a little crowded. Breakfast was above average, but nothing spectacular. Most of the hot foods were individually wrapped breakfast sandwiches and wraps. The wraps were better than the sandwiches. The smoothie was the","Thank you for your detailed insight regarding your recent 3-night stay at our hotel.  An overall great stay is just what we want our guests to experience!
